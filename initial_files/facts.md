Sensor degradation not accounted for




Key Historical Lessons for Risk Assessment

Video analytics reliability degrades 30-40% from lab to deployment
Edge processing essential for meeting <100ms requirement
Minimum 3-month parallel operation with legacy systems recommended
False positive rates during commissioning typically 20-50x operational targets
Network segmentation critical - safety systems need physical isolation options
Model retraining required quarterly minimum to prevent drift
Battery-powered IoT sensors have 25-35% first-year failure rate
Integration testing must include peak load conditions (shift changes, evacuations)
Backup communication must be truly independent (different protocol/medium)
Human oversight essential during first 6 months of operation
