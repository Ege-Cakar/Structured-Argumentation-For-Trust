# SWIFT Risk Assessment Requirements for Large Language Models

## Overview
This document outlines the specific requirements for conducting Structured What-If Technique (SWIFT) risk assessments. Each LLM participant must complete all steps in sequence to ensure comprehensive risk analysis.

## Required SWIFT Methodology Steps

### 1. Guide Word Preparation
**Requirement**: Each participating expert must establish and document relevant guide words before beginning the assessment.
- Generate a comprehensive list of guide words appropriate to the system under review
- Guide words should cover categories such as: timing, quantity, quality, direction, sequence, and human factors
- Document the complete guide word list for reference throughout the assessment process

### 2. Background Analysis
**Requirement**: Clearly articulate the triggering event or condition that necessitates this risk assessment.
- Identify the specific incident, concern, or operational change that prompted the analysis
- Document any regulatory, safety, or business drivers requiring the assessment
- Establish the current state that requires risk evaluation

### 3. Purpose Statement
**Requirement**: Define the specific objectives and desired outcomes of the risk assessment.
- Articulate what the organization aims to achieve through this analysis
- Specify measurable goals (e.g., "improve customer satisfaction ratings" or "reduce operational incidents")
- Align objectives with organizational strategic priorities

### 4. Success Criteria Definition
**Requirement**: Establish quantifiable and qualitative criteria for assessment success.
- Define specific, measurable targets (e.g., "achieve 80% five-star customer reviews")
- Include both direct metrics and indirect indicators of improvement
- Establish timeframes for achievement of success criteria
- Consider leading and lagging indicators of risk mitigation effectiveness

### 5. System Description
**Requirement**: Provide a comprehensive yet concise description of the system or process under assessment.
- Document system boundaries, inputs, outputs, and key interfaces
- Include sufficient technical detail to enable effective risk identification
- Maintain appropriate level of abstraction for the assessment scope
- Identify key stakeholders and their roles within the system

### 6. Risk and Hazard Identification
**Requirement**: Conduct systematic hazard identification using guide words and system decomposition.

**Process Requirements**:
- Apply each guide word systematically to every system component and subprocess
- For each guide word-system combination, generate specific "what-if" scenarios
- Document potential deviations from intended operation
- Consider human factors, equipment failures, and external influences

**Example Application**: 
- Process: "Maintain patient awareness of medical condition"
- Guide Word: "Timing"
- Generated Scenarios: "What if information is provided while patient is sedated?" or "What if updates are delayed beyond acceptable timeframes?"

### 7. Risk Assessment and Evaluation
**Requirement**: For each identified hazard, conduct comprehensive risk analysis.

**Assessment Components**:
- **Consequence Analysis**: Evaluate potential harm severity if the hazard materializes
- **Probability Assessment**: Estimate likelihood of occurrence using available data and expert judgment
- **Risk Acceptability**: Determine whether identified risk levels are acceptable given organizational risk tolerance
- **Technical Analysis Needs**: Identify hazards requiring detailed quantitative risk assessment

### 8. Risk Mitigation Recommendations
**Requirement**: Develop actionable recommendations to reduce identified risks to acceptable levels.
- Propose specific control measures for each unacceptable risk
- Prioritize recommendations based on risk reduction effectiveness and implementation feasibility
- Consider multiple types of controls: elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective measures
- Estimate implementation timelines and resource requirements

### 9. Objective Achievement Assessment
**Requirement**: Evaluate whether the analysis has met its stated objectives.
- Compare findings against the original purpose and success criteria
- Determine if additional detailed risk assessment is required for specific system elements
- Identify any gaps in the analysis that require further investigation
- Document confidence level in the assessment results

### 10. Executive Summary Preparation
**Requirement**: Produce a comprehensive summary document.
- Synthesize key findings, significant risks, and critical recommendations
- Present information in format appropriate for decision-makers
- Include risk prioritization matrix and implementation roadmap
- Ensure summary enables informed risk management decisions

### 11. Supplementary Analysis (Optional)
**Requirement**: If warranted, recommend additional risk assessment methodologies.
- Identify system elements requiring specialized analysis techniques (e.g., FMEA, FTA, HAZOP)
- Justify the need for supplementary analysis based on risk significance or complexity
- Provide guidance on appropriate methodologies for identified gaps

## Documentation Standards
- All steps must be thoroughly documented with clear rationale
- Maintain traceability between guide words, identified hazards, and proposed mitigations
- Use consistent terminology and formatting throughout the assessment
- Ensure reproducibility and auditability of the analysis process

## Quality Assurance Requirements
- Each step must be completed before proceeding to the next
- Cross-reference findings between steps to ensure consistency
- Validate that all system elements have been adequately addressed
- Confirm that the assessment scope has been fully covered
