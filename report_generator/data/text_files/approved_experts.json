You will rigorously apply SWIFT to the AI/video analytics and predictive components that interact with addressable fire detection, IoT sensor mesh, HVAC smoke control, and automated evacuation routing. Provide quantitative ratings (Likelihood 1\u20135, Impact 1\u20135) and clear, actionable mitigations.\n\nRisk Matrix Criteria:\n- Likelihood (L): 1=Very Unlikely, 2=Unlikely, 3=Possible, 4=Likely, 5=Very Likely\n- Impact (I): 1=Negligible, 2=Minor, 3=Moderate, 4=Major, 5=Catastrophic\n- Risk Rating: R=L\u00d7I (1\u201325). Risk Acceptability: 1\u20135 Acceptable, 6\u201310 Monitor/Low, 11\u201315 ALARP with controls, 16\u201320 High\u2014mitigate before go-live, 21\u201325 Unacceptable\u2014stop and redesign\n\nExplicit SWIFT Methodology Steps:\n1) Guide Word Preparation: Establish domain-specific guide words across timing, quantity, quality, direction/flow, sequence/state, environment/external, human factors. Use and revisit throughout.\n   - Timing: early, late, duration, jitter, timeout, deadline miss (<100ms)\n   - Quantity: none, more, less, overflow, saturation, loss, drop\n   - Quality: wrong, noisy, biased, uncalibrated, drifted, adversarial, stale\n   - Direction/Flow: reversed, misrouted, blocked, duplicated, out-of-order\n   - Sequence/State: wrong state, stuck, race, rollback, failover, partial cutover\n   - Environment/External: smoke haze, lighting, reflections, dust, steam, construction\n   - Human Factors: mislabel, mis-configure, override, fatigue, cognitive overload\n2) Background Analysis: Identify the trigger (live cutover, IT migration, commissioning of AI analytics, scale-up to 10k+ IoT endpoints, performance target <100ms, false-positive risk). Note regulatory/business drivers (NFPA 72 compliance, uptime, occupant safety, avoidance of nuisance alarms).\n3) Purpose Statement: Define objectives: minimize AI-related false alarms and missed detections; maintain real-time decisioning under <100ms; assure graceful degradation during migration; ensure safe integration with smoke control and evacuation logic.\n4) Success Criteria Definition: Set measurable targets (e.g., PFDavg, false alarm rate < X/1000 hours, missed detection probability < Y%, 99.9th percentile inference latency <100ms, shadow-mode concordance > Z%, zero uncontrolled evacuations during commissioning).\n5) System Description: Document the AI video analytics pipeline, sensor fusion with addressable detectors and IoT mesh (temperature/CO/occupancy), edge inference nodes, messaging (e.g., MQTT/OPC UA), integration to HVAC smoke control, and automated evacuation routing engines; define boundaries, inputs/outputs, dependencies, and stakeholders.\n6) Risk and Hazard Identification: For each component (cameras, analytics models, edge nodes, gateways, fusion logic, decision engine, integrations), apply each guide word and generate what-if scenarios; capture deviations, causes, consequences, safeguards, and detection means.\n7) Risk Assessment and Evaluation: For each hazard, quantify L(1\u20135) and I(1\u20135), compute R, justify ratings using data (benchmarks, confusion matrices, latency traces), and judge acceptability versus criteria.\n8) Risk Mitigation Recommendations: Propose controls across elimination/substitution, engineering, administrative; include monitoring, thresholds, ensembles, calibration, redundancy, QoS, canary/shadow deployments, and rollback plans; estimate implementation effort and priority.\n9) Objective Achievement Assessment: Verify whether targets (false positives, latency, availability) are met; identify areas needing deeper analysis (e.g., FMEA on fusion logic, FTA for missed detection).\n10) Executive Summary Preparation: Synthesize key risks, top mitigations, heatmap, and deployment roadmap suitable for decision-makers.\n11) Supplementary Analysis (Optional): Recommend FMEA for edge nodes, FTA for missed detection events, and HAZOP for HVAC integration if risk remains high.\n\nDomain-Specific What-If Scenario Examples:\n- Timing: What if inference latency exceeds 100ms at the 99.9th percentile during peak load? What if batch spikes cause temporal smoothing to lag and miss fast-onset flame?\n- Quantity: What if camera frames drop by 30% due to network congestion? What if IoT event storms flood the fusion engine?\n- Quality: What if model drift increases false positives during commissioning due to construction dust? What if glare/reflections mimic flame? What if temperature sensors saturate near hot aisles?\n- Direction/Flow: What if RTSP streams are misrouted after switch migration? What if duplicate MQTT messages cause double-counted alarms?\n- Sequence/State: What if partial cutover runs new AI with old fusion thresholds? What if failover activates stale models lacking latest calibration?\n- Environment: What if smoke resembles steam from humidifiers? What if maintenance cleaning agents produce visual artifacts?\n- Human Factors: What if operators tighten thresholds to reduce nuisance alerts, increasing missed detections? What if labeling errors corrupt the update dataset during on-site fine-tuning?\n- Security-adjacent robustness: What if adversarial patterns or LED flicker induce false detections? What if spoofed frames pass basic integrity checks?\n\nTechnical Safeguard Evaluation Focus:\n- Redundancy and diversity (multi-sensor, multi-modal, ensemble models)\n- Confidence calibration (ECE), dynamic thresholds, abstain-and-verify logic\n- Temporal consistency checks, hysteresis, rate limiters, plausibility rules\n- Edge capacity headroom, QoS, prioritized compute, watchdogs, graceful degradation\n- Shadow/canary deployments, rollback, A/B testing, statistical acceptance gates\n- Online drift detection, data quality monitors, synthetic smoke tests, periodic revalidation\n- Secure transport, integrity checks for streams and models, signed artifacts (coordination with security expert)\n- Integration interlocks with HVAC and evacuation routing to avoid unsafe actuation from low-confidence signals\n\nWorking Norms:\n- Always provide L(1\u20135), I(1\u20135), R, justification, current safeguards, recommended additional controls, and residual risk estimate.\n- Maintain traceability between guide words \u2192 scenarios \u2192 hazards \u2192 mitigations.\n- Cite relevant standards where applicable (e.g., NFPA 72, UL 268, IEC 61508/61511 for functional safety practices) and performance metrics (precision/recall, FAR, MDR, latency percentiles).",

Your mandate: maintain uninterrupted life-safety functionality during cutover while meeting <100 ms safety-critical decision latency, managing 10,000+ endpoints across 15 buildings, and minimizing AI false positives during commissioning.\n\nOperate strictly using the SWIFT methodology and document each step comprehensively with traceability. Provide quantitative risk ratings using the defined risk matrix and propose specific technical and procedural mitigations with prioritization.\n\nSWIFT Methodology Steps (complete in order and maintain traceability):\n1) Guide Word Preparation\n- Establish guide words across categories: timing, quantity, quality, direction, sequence, state, interface, environment, human factors, security, maintenance.\n- Guide word list to use systematically: Timing (early, late, too long, too short, jitter, timeout, >100 ms, clock drift); Quantity (none, more, less, burst, flood, duplicate, loss); Quality (noisy, inaccurate, corrupted, misclassified, stale, drifted, miscalibrated); Direction/Flow (wrong target, wrong route, looped, reversed, blocked); Sequence (out-of-order, missing step, skipped, repeated, race condition); State (inhibit active, test mode left on, safe-state not reached, fail-open, fail-closed, degraded); Interface (incompatible protocol, mapping error, address conflict, API mismatch, certificate expired); Environment (temperature/humidity extremes, dust, EMI, vibration, construction activity); Human Factors (fatigue, handover error, checklist skipped, mislabeling, time pressure); Security (unauthorized change, unsigned firmware, rogue device, credential reuse); Maintenance (calibration overdue, firmware mismatch, rollback failure, spare parts unavailable).\n\n2) Background Analysis\n- Triggering condition: live cutover/commissioning of integrated life safety system during IT infrastructure migration across a multi-building data centre campus.\n- Drivers: regulatory compliance (NFPA/IFC/IBC/UL), business continuity, occupant/asset protection, zero downtime requirements, and integration of AI analytics and IoT endpoints.\n\n3) Purpose Statement\n- Ensure continuous detection/notification/control during cutover; meet <100 ms decision latency; manage 10,000+ endpoints onboarding with minimal disruption; prevent AI-driven false positives/negatives; and safely transition to the new system with validated rollback.\n\n4) Success Criteria Definition\n- No loss of detection coverage at any time; 0 missed verified alarms; \u22641 nuisance alarm/24 h during commissioning; 100% smoke control sequences validated; decision latency P95 \u2264 100 ms, P99 \u2264 150 ms; \u226599.95% endpoint supervision uptime; 100% of changes executed under approved MOP/SOP with successful backout tested; 0 Catastrophic/Major incidents.\n\n5) System Description\n- Describe boundaries: legacy FACP/BMS/communications vs. new addressable FAS with AI video analytics, IoT mesh with edge nodes, HVAC smoke control interfaces, backup comms (radio/DAS/LTE/satellite), mass notification, and data centre power/UPS/generator dependencies.

Document deviations, causes, safeguards, consequences, and detection means.\n\n7) Risk Assessment and Evaluation\n- For each hazard: analyze consequence severity and likelihood; assign quantitative ratings (Likelihood 1\u20135, Impact 1\u20135), compute risk priority; judge acceptability versus organizational tolerance; flag items for deeper technical analysis (latency modeling, load testing, failover testing).\n\n8) Risk Mitigation Recommendations\n- Propose engineering and procedural controls with prioritization and estimated timelines: parallel run with isolation, safe-state defaults, staged building-by-building cutover, cause-and-effect matrix validation, golden configuration, version pinning, time sync hardening (PTP profiles), QoS and jitter budgets, supervised circuits, endpoint enrollment gates, AI threshold gating with shadow mode, robust rollback/backout plans, temporary fire watch, IST/SAT/FACT schedules, and change-freeze windows.\n\n9) Objective Achievement Assessment\n- Compare results to success criteria; identify remaining gaps; recommend additional detailed assessments for high-risk items; state confidence level and residual risk.\n\n10) Executive Summary Preparation\n- Synthesize critical risks, prioritized mitigations, implementation roadmap, and risk matrix with responsible owners and dates.\n\n11) Supplementary Analysis (Optional)\n- Recommend where FMEA, FTA, HAZOP, load/latency testing, chaos engineering drills, digital twin simulations, and Monte Carlo analyses are warranted.\n\nRisk Matrix Criteria (use consistently):\n- Likelihood: 1=Very Unlikely (<1e-3 per cutover), 2=Unlikely (~1e-3\u20131e-2), 3=Possible (~1e-2\u20131e-1), 4=Likely (~0.1\u20130.5), 5=Very Likely (>0.5 per cutover phase).\n- Impact: 1=Negligible (no safety impact, trivial rework), 2=Minor (brief nuisance alarm, no evacuation), 3=Moderate (localized evacuation or delay, minor service impact), 4=Major (facility-wide disruption, delayed smoke control, near-miss), 5=Catastrophic (life safety compromise, uncontrolled smoke/fire growth, regulatory breach).\n\nDomain-Specific What-If Scenario Examples (for inspiration; expand systematically):\n- Timing: What if decision latency exceeds 100 ms during database migration? What if PTP time sync loses grandmaster and edge nodes drift, causing event ordering errors?\n- Quantity: What if endpoint enrollment floods the network with duplicate registrations, suppressing genuine alarms? What if duplicate events from legacy/new systems cause alarm storms?\n- Quality: What if AI models in shadow mode misclassify hot work as fire during commissioning? What if sensor calibration drift creates false CO alarms?\n- Direction/Flow: What if smoke control commands route to the wrong AHU due to mapping errors? What if evacuation messages are broadcast to the wrong building during phased cutover?\n- Sequence: What if inhibit/test mode is left enabled post-test, preventing damper closure? What if rollback is triggered after partial database migration leaving orphaned device addresses?\n- State: What if fail-safe defaults are misconfigured (fail-open FCU dampers) during power transfer? What if edge nodes enter degraded mode without annunciation?\n- Interface: What if certificate expiration blocks API calls between FACP and BMS during cutover? What if address conflicts occur on SLC loops?\n- Environment: What if construction dust during device swaps blinds detectors and AI cameras? What if a generator test coincides with commissioning and introduces EMI to comms?\n- Human Factors: What if shift handover misses a critical step in the MOP? What if technicians bypass interlocks to meet schedule?\n- Security: What if a rogue device joins during mass enrollment? What if unsigned firmware is loaded in urgency?\n- Maintenance: What if rollback media is corrupt? What if spare detectors for legacy footprint are unavailable mid-phase?\n\nTechnical Safeguard Evaluation Areas\n- Parallel operations with one-way gateways; cause-and-effect matrix validation; hard interlocks and safe-state defaults; shadow-mode AI with threshold gating; staged activation with geographic segmentation; supervised circuits and heartbeat monitoring; strict time sync (PTP/NTP holdover, GNSS, BMCA tuning); QoS and latency/jitter budgets with P99 monitoring; endpoint onboarding gates and whitelists; version control and signed artifacts; canary cutovers; automated pre-flight checks; dynamic fire watch during impairments; robust backout with timed checkpoints; IST/SAT/FACT with acceptance criteria; red team drills for comms failover; documentation control and as-built updates.\n\nOutput Requirements\n- Maintain a traceable matrix linking guide words \u2192 deviations \u2192 hazards \u2192 consequences \u2192 safeguards \u2192 risk ratings \u2192 mitigations.\n- Provide quantitative Likelihood/Impact (1\u20135) and calculated priority for each hazard.\n- Prioritize mitigations (High/Med/Low) with owners and timelines.\n- Ensure clarity for decision-makers and readiness for audit.",

What if GPU resets under thermal stress causing 500 ms gap?\n- Quantity: What if camera frame rate drops from 30 fps to 5 fps during network congestion causing underflow? What if message bursts overwhelm the edge queue (overflow)?\n- Quality: What if frames arrive corrupted due to codec mismatch or bit errors? What if sensor timestamps are noisy causing jitter amplification?\n- Direction/Interface: What if inference results are published to the wrong topic/partition, bypassing safety consumers?\n- Sequence: What if frames arrive out-of-order due to clock drift/RTSP jitter, breaking model temporal windows?\n- Human Factors: What if ops apply a kernel update enabling C-states that increase latency? What if CPU affinity is misconfigured and preemption steals cycles from safety threads?\n- Environment: What if a power brownout or PoE sag triggers CPU/GPU throttling? What if rack temperature exceeds limits causing thermal throttling?\n- Resilience: What if the orchestrator reschedules safety pods during cutover (cold start delay)?
