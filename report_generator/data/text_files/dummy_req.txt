INTEGRATED LIFE SAFETY SYSTEM DEPLOYMENT RISK ASSESSMENT

Project: Smart Building Integration - Engineering Department, West Campus Data Centre and Work Centre 
Scope: AI-Driven Fire Detection with Predictive Analytics

Deploying next-generation system integrating:
- Addressable fire detection with video flame/smoke analytics
- Integration with HVAC for intelligent smoke control
- IoT sensor mesh (temperature, CO, occupancy) with edge processing
- Automated evacuation routing based on real-time fire modeling
- Backup communication channels

Technical challenges:
- Maintaining detection during IT infrastructure migration
- Managing 10,000+ IoT endpoints across 15 buildings
- Ensuring <100ms response time for all safety-critical decisions
- Preventing AI false positives during commissioning

Assess cybersecurity risks, AI failure modes, and system integration hazards during live cutover.
