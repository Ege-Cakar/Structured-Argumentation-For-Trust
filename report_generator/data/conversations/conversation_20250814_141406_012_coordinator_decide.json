  "coordinator_instructions": "Produce SWIFT Step 6 \u2014 Hazard and Hazardous Scenario Identification for the AI-driven fire detection and predictive analytics scope. This supports the Background and Success Criteria by systematically applying the canonical guide words to the AI sensing and inference pipeline under live cutover states, and it challenges any assumption that analytics may directly actuate life-safety functions without listed cross-zone confirmation and safe-state inhibits. Frame the section as argumentative prose, not lists, and tie every scenario to concrete system elements defined in Step 5.\n\nScope and decomposition to analyze: addressable detection with video smoke/flame analytics at the edge, IoT sensor fusion (temperature, CO, occupancy), edge pre-processing and inference engines, model management and update pipeline, event fusion and thresholding, publishing to broker, controller ingestion and cross-zone confirmation, and operator oversight during commissioning. Anchor hazards to the Step 5 trust zones and conduits: Edge Analytics Zone, Safety Control Zone, Broker and Controller Zone, Time Authority Zone, Management and Identity Zone, Integration Zone, and Backup Communications Zone. Respect commissioning states from Step 2: shadow monitoring, supervised test with bounded authority, and live control with verified handback.\n\nMethod and rigor: apply the Step 1 canonical guide words across timing, quantity, quality, direction/flow, sequence, state, interface, environment, human factors, security, maintenance, and AI/data integrity for each decomposed subcomponent and its interfaces. For each primary guide word\u2013component pairing, generate explicit what-if scenarios in prose, for example: what if timing jitter or clock drift renders frame timestamps stale at the broker during supervised test; what if quantity burst or duplicate events from the edge analytics flood the broker; what if quality is degraded by dust, hot work, or lens occlusion; what if direction or routing misaddresses an AI event to the wrong zone; what if sequence is out of order between listed detection and AI metadata, causing spurious cross-zone confirmation; what if state such as test mode left on or inhibit active persists after supervised test; what if interface mapping or certificate expiry breaks event signing; what if human factors such as overtrust during commissioning lead operators to bypass nuisance gating; and what if cybersecurity threats like spoofed event metadata or data poisoning affect inference. Do not score risk yet; stay in identification and scenario generation.\n\nTraceability expectations: for each scenario, embed in the prose the following tags as explicit phrases so they are searchable later, without using tables: primary guide word and one secondary guide word; subsystem and interface(s) from Step 5; commissioning state to which the scenario most applies; success criteria references it would threaten (for example, SC-1 latency and ordering, SC-2 supervision and nuisance, SC-3 routing and safe-state, SC-4 commissioning gates, SC-5 evidence and listings); and note whether actual data would need to be obtained to validate the scenario (for example, baseline false-positive rates during construction, PTP offset and holdover behavior, per-hop latency percentiles, camera occlusion statistics, or enrollment audit outcomes). Maintain alignment with the life-safety compliance constraints that analytics remain supplemental unless independently listed and require cross-zone confirmation and safe-state inhibition on analytics-only triggers.\n\nBoundaries and exclusions: do not propose mitigations or probability/severity ratings; that belongs to Steps 7 and 8. Keep your focus on AI detection and analytics hazards and their immediate interfaces to listed detection, fusion, broker/controller paths, and time authority. Where scenarios depend on HVAC smoke control, evacuation routing, or physical security egress behavior, reference the interface and commissioning state clearly, but do not elaborate those domains\u2019 internal hazards.\n\nQuality bar and tone: write in tight, decisive prose with explicit cause\u2013deviation\u2013consequence chains, and avoid bullet fragments. Open the section with two sentences that state, verbatim, \u201cThis supports the prior Background, Success Criteria, and System Description by mapping AI-specific deviations to concrete interfaces and commissioning states.\u201d and \u201cHowever, this challenges any assumption that analytics may directly actuate life-safety functions by documenting failure modes that require listed cross-zone confirmation and safe-state inhibits.\u201d Close with a short paragraph identifying which two or three interface pairs require immediate deep-dive in subsequent domain hazard passes, noting that verification is required.",

          "text": "For SWIFT Step 1, I propose three domain-specific guide-word clusters to anchor all later what-if generation. Because the system must act in less than one hundred milliseconds and remain stable during change, these emphasize temporal integrity, perception fidelity, and fusion-to-actuation correctness.\n\n1) Temporal integrity under hard real time\nBecause late or disordered signals skew fusion, include: early, late, variable delay, jitter, burst, timeout, deadline miss, clock drift or skew, buffering lag, backlog, out-of-order, duplication, gap or drop, replay during failover, conflicting timestamps. Therefore we expose hazards where temporal smoothing windows, hysteresis, or debouncing are mismatched to rapid-onset flame or smoke growth.\n\n2) Perception fidelity, drift, and environmental confounders\nBecause false positives during commissioning and missed detections often arise from input quality, include: wrong, noisy, biased, uncalibrated, drifted, stale, adversarial patterning; and environment: haze, dust, steam, glare, reflections, strobing lights, lens contamination, focus shift, occlusion, scene clutter. Since quantity can degrade perception, also include: more or less frames, saturation, overflow, compression artifacts, loss. Therefore we systematically probe conditions where construction activity, hot aisle shimmer, or cleaning practices mimic smoke, flame, or people.\n\n3) Fusion, state management, and actuation integrity\nBecause incorrect state or routing can misdrive heating ventilation and air conditioning and evacuation, include sequence or state: wrong state, partial cutover, rollback, failover with stale models, threshold mismatch, race, stuck; direction or flow: misrouted, blocked, broadcast leakage, duplicated; human factors: mislabel, misconfigure, override, threshold creep, fatigue, cognitive overload; security-adjacent robustness: spoofed frames, integrity bypass, model tampering, dataset contamination. Therefore we capture hazards where low-confidence analytics trigger interlocks, or cross-modal gates suppress genuine alarms.\n\nWhat gaps do you see, especially regarding data governance during on-site fine tuning and cross-clock alignment across vendors?\n\nSWIFT Step 1 \u2013 Canonical guide words for AI fire detection and analytics\n\nWhile the three proposed clusters are strong, they under-specify cross-system timebase alignment and data governance during on\u2011site fine\u2011tuning, which materially drive both false alarms and missed detections. Therefore, the following canonical sets will anchor all subsequent what\u2011if work across components and vendors.\n\nTiming and timebase alignment: Because fusion correctness depends on temporal coherence under one hundred milliseconds, include early, late, variable delay, jitter, burst, timeout, deadline miss, clock skew and drift across vendors, timestamp format mismatch, step changes during resynchronization, backlog accumulation, replay during failover, and out\u2011of\u2011order arrivals.\n\nQuantity and load: Because congestion distorts perception and fusion, include none, more, less, overflow, saturation, drop, frame rate throttling under contention, Internet of Things event storms that amplify upstream, duplicate retries that inflate counts, and rate limiting that truncates critical evidence.\n\nQuality and robustness: Because input fidelity governs precision and recall, include wrong class, noisy, biased, uncalibrated, drifted, stale model or calibration, adversarial flicker or patterning, compression artifacts at low bitrate, occlusion or lens contamination, thermal shimmer near hot aisles, sensor saturation, and spoofed or replayed frames that pass weak integrity checks.\n\nDirection and flow control: Because routing determines which logic acts, include misrouted streams after network change, blocked priority paths under quality of service shifts, duplicated or retained messages replayed on reconnect, broadcast leakage across zones, and out\u2011of\u2011order delivery that defeats temporal guards.\n\nSequence and state management: Because mixed modes create latent hazards, include wrong state, partial cutover mismatch, race or stuck states, rollback or failover with stale calibration, inconsistent thresholds across instances, test or maintenance suppressions, and mode confusion between simulation and live.\n\nEnvironment and external conditions: Because scenes vary in the field, include smoke\u2011like steam or fog, dust and construction haze, glare and reflections, strobing lighting, vibration and camera shift, airflow patterns that divert smoke, and cleaning practices that introduce visual artifacts.\n\nHuman and governance factors: Because people and process shape risk, include mislabel during on\u2011site tuning, misconfiguration and threshold creep to silence nuisance alerts, fatigue during multi\u2011alarm storms, dataset provenance and consent gaps, contaminated fine\u2011tune sets, weak versioning and approval of models and thresholds, and missing shadow\u2011mode acceptance gates.\n\n1) Because cross vendor clocks drift and failover reorders events, fusion can misplace alarms or suppress real ones, therefore heating ventilation and air conditioning and evacuation commands may conflict. Given brittle time bases and sub one hundred millisecond deadlines, Likelihood four, Impact five, Risk twenty high, mitigate before go live. However, current safeguards use network time synchronization, yet they do not ensure temporal consensus. Therefore, recommend Precision Time Protocol with hardware timestamping, cross stream coherence checks, two modality temporal gating, and fallback to conventional detectors aligned with life safety codes. Consequently, residual Likelihood two, Impact four, Risk eight.\n\n2) Because on site fine tuning often uses opportunistic footage under dust, glare, and steam, the model can learn to suppress true smoke or flame, therefore missed detection rises when nuisance pressure is highest. Given commissioning variability and limited holdout validation, Likelihood three, Impact five, Risk fifteen. However, current safeguards include vendor locked models and acceptance tests, yet governance is frequently informal. Therefore, recommend strict data lineage and approval, signed training data, shadow mode gates, synthetic smoke benchmarks, out of distribution alarms, and do not relax fusion thresholds without two independent sensors. Consequently, residual Likelihood two, Impact four, Risk eight.\n\n3) Because occupancy inference and smoke prediction can err under occlusion, privacy masking, or sensor drop, dynamic signage may route occupants toward hazardous corridors, therefore automation can create harm greater than a static plan. Given model generalization limits and field variability, Likelihood three, Impact five, Risk fifteen. However, current safeguards include static egress plans and human wardens, yet automated routing may override without guard rails. Therefore, recommend multi source validation for route changes, invariant prohibition on routing through unconfirmed hazard zones, uncertainty based fallback to static plans, and operator confirmation for major reroutes. Consequently, residual Likelihood two, Impact five, Risk ten.\n\nWhat gaps do you see, and which assumptions need stress tests?\n\nSWIFT Step 1 \u2013 Domain\u2011specific guide words for artificial intelligence fire detection and analytics\n\nThe creative clusters are a strong start; however they underweight cross\u2011vendor timebase alignment and formal data governance during on\u2011site fine tuning, which repeatedly drive misdetections and nuisance alarms. Therefore the following focused sets will anchor all subsequent what\u2011if generation across components and vendors.\n\nTiming and timebase alignment: Because fusion must be temporally coherent under one hundred milliseconds across vendors, include early, late, variable delay, jitter, burst, timeout, deadline miss, clock drift and skew, timestamp mismatch, resynchronization steps, backlog buildup, replay during failover, and out of order arrival. Therefore scenarios will pressure test smoothing, hysteresis, and debouncing windows.\n\nPerception fidelity and environmental confounders: Because perception errors drive both false alarms and missed detections during commissioning, include wrong class, noisy, biased, uncalibrated, drifted, stale models, compression artifacts, occlusion, lens contamination, glare, reflections, strobing lights, steam, dust, haze, thermal shimmer, and adversarial visual patterns. Therefore we will probe construction, cleaning, and hot aisle conditions.\n\nQuantity and load: Because congestion and compute contention distort evidence flow, include none, more, less, overflow, saturation, drops, frame rate throttling, event storms, duplicate retries, and rate limiting that truncates critical context windows. Therefore we will examine headroom, backpressure, and prioritization of life safety traffic.\n\nSequence, cutover, and failover state integrity: Because mixed modes and routing mistakes can misdrive heating ventilation and air conditioning and evacuation, include wrong state, partial cutover, rollback, failover with stale calibration, threshold mismatch, race, stuck, misrouted or blocked streams, duplication, and broadcast leakage across zones. Therefore interlocks and mode protections must be explicit.\n\nHuman and governance factors for data and thresholds: Because hurried tuning and nuisance pressure corrupt model behavior, include mislabel during on\u2011site fine tuning, misconfiguration, threshold creep, operator override, fatigue, dataset provenance gaps, contaminated training sets, weak versioning, unsigned artifacts, and missing shadow\u2011mode acceptance gates. Therefore approvals and conservative fallbacks must be enforced.\n\nThe created section intentionally challenges the creative clusters by stating that cross vendor timebase alignment and formal data governance were underweighted, because these factors routinely cause fusion errors and governance drift during commissioning. Therefore, it elevates timing coherence and data lineage to first class guide words that will systematically surface hazards with real consequence.\n\nIt structures the guide words across timing, quantity, quality, direction and flow, sequence and state, environment, and human and governance, because comprehensive coverage prevents blind spots during what if generation across cameras, inference, fusion, and actuation. Therefore, it directly supports later scenario building for peak load, partial cutover, and commissioning conditions without requiring rework.\n\nIt deepens the timing set to include clock skew, resynchronization steps, backlog buildup, and out of order arrivals, because these specific mechanisms explain why debouncing and hysteresis fail under less than one hundred millisecond deadlines. Therefore, it creates a traceable link between temporal faults and misdriven heating ventilation and air conditioning or evacuation logic.\n\nIt expands perception fidelity to include compression artifacts, lens contamination, thermal shimmer, and adversarial patterns, because these are repeatedly observed sources of false positives and missed detections during construction and cleaning. Therefore, environmental variability is explicitly integrated into later tests and acceptance gates.\n\nIt adds governance items such as dataset provenance gaps, unsigned artifacts, and missing shadow mode gates, because hurried on site fine tuning often degrades safety performance under nuisance pressure. Therefore, model and threshold changes will be constrained by process controls during migration.\n\nLimitations remain where actual distributions and rates are required, because latency tails, drop rates, calibration stability, and drift magnitudes are site dependent. Therefore, actual data would need to be obtained to parameterize thresholds, capacity headroom, and acceptance criteria.",

Because smoke control actuators have inertia, fail positions, and dwell requirements, we elevated timing \u201cNo or None\u201d and sequencing terms to capture absent or withheld actions explicitly.\n\nWe strengthened governance because multi-master conflicts are a recurrent root cause. Therefore we added priority inversion, unauthorized writes, and manual hand\u2013off\u2013auto mispositioning to force scenarios where firefighter smoke control panel must preempt analytics and building automation writes.\n\nThe inclusion of end switch failed and proof of flow missing is deliberate because feedback plausibility, not just command issuance, determines containment. Consequently, we can generate scenarios where a fan proves status without airflow, which has occurred in practice, with source verification required.\n\nWe expanded direction and path with bypass open and short circuit because field bypasses and mis-set reliefs can collapse pressure differentials. Additionally, door force exceeded anchors the pressure targets to egress usability so the analysis connects airflow to human operability.\n\nWe added ride through failed, brownout, and transient because automatic transfer switching and generator stabilization often trip variable drives. Therefore, we will evaluate start sequencing and minimum off times against less than one hundred millisecond command budgets that controls must meet.\n\nWhile some may argue \u201cNo or None\u201d duplicates \u201cOmitted\u201d, it captures dead controllers and missing heartbeats on networks, which is diagnostically distinct. Likewise, some may place door force only in acceptance testing; however, embedding it at guide-word level aligns scenarios with code-constrained outcomes.\n\nThe subsystem mapping is intentionally broad because cross-building propagation, time synchronization, and inter-building routing create latent, simultaneous, and out-of-sequence risks. Therefore we called out desynchronized time and heartbeat lost to bind latency and integrity to operability.\n\nData gaps remain and require verification: end-to-end latency measurements, network quality of service and virtual local area network isolation, authoritative write matrix, sensor placement details, and measured door opening forces under load. These items must be evidenced before scenario scoring.",

Because identity and secure configuration determine whether events are trustworthy, therefore these deviations dominate during enrollment and fault states.\nI map Edge gateways and controllers: Overloaded, Congested, Jittery, Out-of-order, Stale, Spoofed, Tampered, Misrouted. Because gateways arbitrate priority and translate protocols under load, therefore overload and ordering faults become deadline misses or wrong actions.\nI map Message brokers and decision services: Burst, Overloaded, Starved, Duplicated, Missing, Stale, Unauthorized.

Because enrollment and revocation gate command acceptance, therefore these drive authority at the network layer.\nI map Time synchronization system: Drifted (time), Desynchronized, Early, Late, Before, After, Out-of-order.

Because policy changes alter queues and routes live, therefore misuse is a systemic risk.\nI map Backup communication links: Incompatible, Slower, Congested, Misrouted, Isolated, Partitioned.

Because observability must be faithful, therefore these deviations hide or mimic deadline violations.\nI map Cutover process control: Early, Late, Unsafe default, Misconfigured, Bypassed, Unauthorized.

Because Precision Time Protocol with hardware timestamping, Time Sensitive Networking scheduling and preemption, Building Automation and Control Network Secure Connect life\u2011safety priorities, Quality of Service preemption, and Internet Group Management Protocol storm control are the dominant levers for sub one hundred millisecond behavior, we should carry these explicitly into hazard hypotheses to avoid dilution later.\nI caution While \u201cPower loss\u201d is captured globally, it is underapplied in subsystem mapping. Because building\u2011wide power events often co\u2011occur with fire conditions and trigger switch reboot, path reconvergence, and desynchronization, we should explicitly attach Physical damage and Power loss to network fabric, time synchronization, and backup links to surface storm, partition, and drift cascades.\nI observe While Public Key Infrastructure is listed, scaling and liveness failure modes are not singled out. Because certificate enrollment, revocation, and validation can stall at campus scale when Certificate Revocation List sizes grow or Online Certificate Status Protocol is unreachable, we should create hazards that combine Stale, Unauthenticated, and Unauthorized for gateways and decision services, with explicit attention to stapling and cache behavior.\nI observe While brokers and controllers are grouped, this masks distinct risks. Because broker redelivery semantics under burst conditions interact with controller scheduling and preemption differently, we should separate brokers from decision engines so that Duplicated, Missing, and Starved at brokers do not get conflated with Slower, Jittery, and Out\u2011of\u2011order at controllers.\nI observe While backup links include Incompatible and Slower, the typical Maximum Transmission Unit or Maximum Segment Size mismatch and added encryption overhead are not named.

          "text": "I reviewed the guide word mapping and identified the following gaps and expansions.\n\nThe guide word mapping is strong because it centers timing, direction, sequence, interfaces, and integrity across routing, notification, and behavior. However, it under-specifies operator confirmation gating for high-consequence state changes, which matters because unauthorized or erroneous re-route flips can create contradictory cues.\n\nThe routing defaults are sensible because falling back to static egress limits misdirection under low confidence. Nevertheless, without hysteresis and hold-times, arrows can oscillate during marginal sensor states, therefore an anti-flap rule, minimum dwell, and suppression rather than rapid reversal should be added.\n\nThe intelligibility focus is appropriate because mechanical noise and reverberation degrade comprehension. Yet, the mapping does not explicitly bind message length, language selection logic, and acoustic priority to latency budgets, therefore include constraints on message duration, deterministic language routing, and preemption rules traceable to the specified performance targets.\n\nThe human behavior section is useful because it recognizes clustering and habitual exit bias. Still, accessibility and refuge specifics are too general, therefore add guide words for assistance dispatch failure, refuge two-way communication failure, evacuation chair unavailability, and door hardware force exceedance under load.\n\nInterfaces are covered broadly because lost links and unsynchronized states are listed. While that is helpful, backup communication paths and radio systems deserve explicit guide words for stairwell coverage gaps, quality of service prioritization failure, and battery autonomy shortfall during extended events.\n\nSecurity and cutover hazards are acknowledged because spoofing and test mode are named. However, mobile notification misuse and multilingual mapping errors are not explicit, therefore add guide words for wrong geofence, wrong language package, and misaligned building-to-building zone mapping during campus-wide events.\n\nFinally, cross-system impacts need one more lens because heating, ventilation, and air conditioning smoke control sequencing changes ambient noise and door pressures. Therefore, add guide words for sequence misalignment that increases noise during announcements and door force spikes that stall egress.",

Therefore we adopt it with targeted extensions and clarifications and declare this list a mandatory checklist for all components.\n\nGuide word categories and canonical set\nTiming: use early, late, jitter, preempted, priority inversion, garbage collection pause, reset stall, interrupt moderation, and deadline miss budget exhausted, because these directly breach deterministic timing.\nQuantity: use more, less, none, overflow, underflow, burst, queue growth, and backpressure, because saturation and depletion create hidden latency.\nQuality: use noisy, corrupted, degraded, out of specification, timestamp drift, and clock skew, because fidelity and temporal accuracy govern inference and control.\nDirection: use wrong path, wrong node, wrong interface, wrong topic or partition, wrong queue, and schema mismatch, because misrouting silently bypasses safety consumers.\nSequence: use out of order, skipped, repeated, duplicated, stale, and replayed, because temporal windows and debouncing logic break.\nHuman factors: use misconfigured, overridden, untrained, fatigued, and blinded by alerts, because operational pressure reintroduces nondeterminism.\nInterfaces: use incompatible, version drift, application binary interface break, driver to kernel mismatch, and codec mismatch, because upgrades silently break data and execution paths.\nEnvironment: use overheat, brownout, vibration, electromagnetic interference, and thermal throttling headroom exhausted, because derating induces stalls and resets.\nResilience: use failover slow, failover never, degraded, cold start, split brain, and orchestration reschedule jitter, because continuity hinges on fast and ordered recovery.\nSecurity performance: use throttled by control, denial of service, resource starvation, endpoint scan contention, encryption overhead, and sidecar interference, because controls contend with safety workloads.\nMaintenance: use patched, live migrated, rollback failed, feature flag drift, and model load increase, because change alters timing budgets.\n\nSubsystem mapping checklist (apply all guide words)\nEdge compute nodes and operating system: emphasize interrupt paths, power states, non uniform memory access locality, and cache effects, because these shape worst case latency.\nAccelerators and their schedulers: emphasize graphics processing unit preemption, memory pressure, context resets, and driver updates, because scheduler behavior dominates inference determinism.\nNetworking fabric, message bus, and video ingest: emphasize backpressure and queueing, head of line blocking, codec negotiation, and topic or partition correctness, because these govern end to end flow.\nTime synchronization and clocks: emphasize bounded offset monitoring, hardware timestamping health, and monotonic clock usage, because causality and ordering depend on time integrity.\nOrchestration and failover: emphasize cold start delay, eviction or admission jitter, image pull stalls, and state handoff, because rescheduling threatens the sub one hundred millisecond objective.\n\nI note that The section deliberately critiques and extends the creative draft because several latent tail-latency drivers were underweighted. Specifically, backpressure, accelerator scheduler behavior, orchestration admission delays, and time synchronization edge cases routinely create deadline breaches; therefore these were promoted to first-class guide words.\n\nI note that Because deterministic behavior depends on explicit slack management, we added \u201cdeadline miss budget exhausted\u201d and \u201cinterrupt moderation\u201d under timing. These capture driver coalescing and slack depletion that frequently break the sub one hundred millisecond objective.\n\nI note that Although quantity hazards were listed, the original set did not force discovery of latent queue growth. Therefore we added queue growth and backpressure so flow control can be audited end to end rather than inferred indirectly. Since inference correctness hinges on temporal fidelity, we added timestamp drift and clock skew under quality, because these cause out-of-order windows and false positives.\n\nI note that While direction and interface risks existed, schema mismatch was implicit rather than explicit. Therefore it is now called out to compel contract verification for messages and codecs. Because recovery can itself create jitter, we added orchestration reschedule jitter under resilience to link rescheduling to safety deadlines.\n\nI state that The subsystem mapping consolidates network, message bus, and video ingest as a single flow-control path, since head-of-line blocking and negotiation span these layers. However, to avoid overlap with content-focused domains, we bound this to latency and ordering, not semantics.\n\nI note that Some may contend model complexity dominates latency, yet field traces often show scheduler stalls and queueing dominate the ninety ninth percentile. Therefore we propose high-resolution tracing and partitioned experiments to apportion contributions, with actual data to be obtained.\n\nI emphasize that We surfaced non uniform memory access and cache locality because these drive worst-case latency on multicore edge nodes; consequently the checklist now motivates explicit pinning and locality validation. A residual concern is dynamic frequency scaling and thermal derating; we address this via \u201cthermal throttling headroom exhausted\u201d to enforce monitoring and guards.",

Because these conditions can invalidate otherwise sound controls during live work, we define a commissioning\u2011focused canonical set and map it to cutover subsystems.\n\nCanonical guide words for commissioning (use verbatim in later steps)\n\nTiming: use early, late, too long, too short, jitter, timeout, greater than one hundred milliseconds, and clock drift because latency and time base integrity dominate during migration.\n\nQuantity: use none, more, less, burst, flood, duplicate, and loss because endpoint onboarding and dual systems can overwhelm or starve safety channels.\n\nQuality: use noisy, inaccurate, corrupted, misclassified, stale, drifted, and miscalibrated because field tuning and construction confounders degrade evidence.\n\nDirection and flow: use wrong target, wrong route, looped, reversed, and blocked because bridging and remapping can misaddress commands and alarms.\n\nSequence: use out of order, missing step, skipped, repeated, and race condition because method of procedure errors and automation races are common in live work.\n\nState: use inhibit active, test mode left on, safe state not reached, fail open, fail closed, and degraded because suppression states and fail positions determine safety during impairments.\n\nInterface: use incompatible protocol, mapping error, address conflict, application programming interface mismatch, and certificate expired because cross\u2011system integration is most volatile at cutover.\n\nEnvironment: use temperature or humidity extremes, dust, electromagnetic interference, vibration, and construction activity because commissioning coincides with build activity and power transitions.\n\nHuman factors: use fatigue, handover error, checklist skipped, mislabeling, and time pressure because multi\u2011day phased work stresses crews and governance.\n\nSecurity: use unauthorized change, unsigned firmware, rogue device, and credential reuse because urgency tempts bypassing controls during enrollment and patching.\n\nMaintenance: use calibration overdue, firmware mismatch, rollback failure, and spare parts unavailable because reversibility and equivalency hinge on ready parts and known\u2011good versions.\n\nSubsystem mapping and rationale\n\nChange control, method of procedure, and authority handover gates: Because sequencing and approvals set safe preconditions, therefore these guide words expose skipped steps, unauthorized changes, and race conditions.\n\nParallel run, isolation gateways, and shadow\u2011mode gating: Because dual paths can create duplicate or missing alarms, therefore quantity and direction words frame alarm storms versus suppression.\n\nTest, disable, and inhibit with impairment permits and dynamic fire watch: Because muted functions can persist, therefore state words capture residual suppression after testing.\n\nConfiguration and database migration with version and certificate control: Because mapping and trust errors sever links, therefore interface and quality words surface silent breakages.\n\nRollback validation and timed checkpoints: Because safe retreat must be deterministic, therefore maintenance and sequence words guard reversibility.\n\nThe created section deliberately centers commissioning authority, suppression states, and partial migration because prior timing, analytics, and networking lists, while strong, did not bind hazards to the real control points that actually fail during live work. Consequently, the canonical guide words are tailored to expose failures from test mode suppression, authority handover gaps, partial cutover, and rollback validation, which are the dominant sources of silent impairment.\n\nBy mapping the guide words to change control gates, parallel run with isolation and shadow\u2011mode gating, test and inhibit governance with impairment permits and dynamic fire watch, configuration and certificate trust, and rollback checkpoints, the section establishes clear traceability from deviations to the levers that prevent alarm loss, alarm storms, or misrouted commands. This is necessary because deterministic compute alone cannot compensate for a muted function or a wrong authority path.\n\nWhile the edge computing contribution correctly stresses scheduler and queue hazards, it fails to consider that a perfect latency profile is irrelevant if inhibit or disable states persist past testing; therefore our emphasis on state and sequence closes that gap. Conversely, our section could over\u2011rely on procedural controls unless paired with automated pre\u2011flight checks and continuous monitors; therefore later steps should bind each guide word to measurable gates such as decision latency percentiles, duplicate suppression counters, and supervision uptime, with actual data to be obtained.\n\nTwo residual gaps warrant expansion in subsequent steps. First, backup communication channel failover and message scoping for mass notification should be explicitly tied to direction and sequence words to prevent cross\u2011building misbroadcasts. Second, time synchronization holdover behavior under grandmaster loss and monotonic clock guarantees should be tied to commissioning states to prevent misordered actions during authority transitions.",

What gaps do you see?\n\nSWIFT Step 1 \u2013 Canonical guide words and subsystem mapping (Life safety functional safety and code compliance)\n\nBecause authority, supervision, and certification boundaries constrain all domains, this canonical vocabulary anchors hazard discovery and aligns cause and effect and authority precedence.\n\nBecause deviations in timing, quantity, quality, direction, and sequence reveal failures, use: early, late, faster, slower; no or none, more, less; too much, too little; degraded, noisy, drift, uncalibrated, out of specification; reverse, other than; out of order, skipped, duplicated, conflicting, stuck, latent.\n\nBecause human performance shapes outcomes, include: misuse, overtrust, undertrust, fatigue, training gap, bypass left in, test mode left on, reset or silence misapplied.\n\nBecause environment and power can corrupt sensing and survivability, include: electromagnetic interference or compatibility issues, heat, smoke, water, corrosive atmosphere, dust, vibration; loss of power, brownout, single point of failure, common cause failure, notification appliance load exceeded, pathway survivability not achieved, emergency power transfer unsafe.\n\nBecause communications determinism governs response, include: loss of communications, jitter, latency greater than one hundred milliseconds, desynchronization, partitioned network, time synchronization drift, ambiguous clock authority.\n\nBecause cybersecurity and data integrity can degrade safety indirectly, include: tampering, spoofing, privilege creep, insecure update path, certificate expiry; model drift, false positive, false negative, data poisoning, unverified update, unvalidated training domain shift, explainability gap.\n\nBecause compliance is a hard constraint, include: unlisted component, nonconforming installation, unapproved variance, documentation gap, listing invalidating change, evidence of conformity missing, supervision versus alarm misclassification, annunciation masked, cross zone verification misapplied, latching logic error, safe state transition on fault.\n\nBecause maintenance and change control can leave unsafe residue, include: rollback fails, version mismatch, configuration drift, commissioning aid left in place, permit to work missing, fire watch required but absent.\n\nBecause interfaces allocate authority, include: authority precedence inversion, unsafe interaction, contract mismatch, segregation breach between life safety and non life safety, and unsafe default ownership on loss.\n\nSubsystem mapping\n\nTherefore sensors and analytics emphasize timing, quality, environment, data and artificial intelligence, and supervision semantics for health monitoring and fault annunciation.\n\nTherefore control panels and field devices emphasize sequence, latching, fail safe default, power integrity, single points, listings scope, and supervision semantics.\n\nTherefore networks, pathways, and backup communications emphasize communications determinism, cybersecurity, survivability level, time synchronization authority, and authority precedence under partition.\n\nTherefore heating, ventilation, and air conditioning smoke control interfaces emphasize command direction, conflicting orders, safe state on loss, compliance boundaries, and code timing.\n\nTherefore evacuation routing and notification emphasize sequence correctness, egress conflict, annunciation masking risks, performance timing, and notification appliance loading.\n\nTherefore management, logging, and time services emphasize documentation completeness, audit retention, version integrity, and authoritative time for cause and effect traceability.\n\nTherefore approvals and commissioning emphasize acceptance test completeness, record of completion integrity, variance control, fire watch governance, and conformance with National Fire Protection Association and Underwriters Laboratories.\n\nTherefore power and energy storage emphasize redundancy strategy, ride through behavior, brownout tolerance, and segregation between life safety and non life safety sources.\n\nThe created section establishes a comprehensive and life safety centric guide word set and subsystem mapping anchored in authority, supervision, and certification boundaries. This is appropriate because life safety acceptance hinges on conformance and deterministic behavior, therefore traceability from guide word to subsystem is defensible.\n\nWhile broad coverage is valuable, the vocabulary risks dilution during analysis sessions because too many near synonyms can fragment scenario capture. Therefore I recommend clustering guide words into enforceable tags per subsystem and tagging each scenario with one primary and one secondary guide word for auditability.\n\nThe compliance and artificial intelligence boundaries are listed but not yet operationalized, because the text does not explicitly require that nonlisted analytics remain supplemental and do not directly drive releasing or life safety control actions. Therefore add a rule that artificial intelligence outputs require cross zone confirmation by listed detection or command inhibition to a safe state on analytics only triggers, with the exact listing scope verified with vendors and the authority having jurisdiction.\n\nThe timing and time authority items are strong, yet they do not force a quantitative latency allocation across sensors, networks, control panels, and actuators. Therefore require an end to end latency budget and jitter limits with measured distributions under worst credible load; actual data would need to be obtained before commissioning.\n\nThe interfaces grouping mixes backup radios with general networks, which can hide unique survivability and listing constraints. Therefore separate emergency responder radio communication systems as a distinct subsystem with pathway survivability, interference, and listing checks traced to acceptance tests.\n\nHuman factors content is solid, but impairment governance is implicit rather than explicit. Therefore mandate a written impairment plan, notification to the authority having jurisdiction, and fire watch initiation when supervision is lost, with checklists to remove temporary bypasses.",

Because free egress, lockdown, delayed egress, interlocks, and dynamic routing must coexist under sub\u2011one\u2011hundred\u2011millisecond safety decisions, we emphasize local determinism and nonblocking supervision.\n\nCanonical guide words for this domain.\n\nTiming: early, late, faster, slower, jitter, deadline\u2011miss, queueing, clock\u2011skew.\n\nQuantity: none, less, more, burst, storm.\n\nQuality: wrong, degraded, noisy, drift, miscalibrated.\n\nDirection and routing: reverse, misroute, wrong\u2011zone, wrong\u2011door, cross\u2011zone.\n\nSequence: before, after, out\u2011of\u2011order, race.\n\nLocation: misplaced, isolation\u2011boundary\u2011breach.\n\nDuration: intermittent, stuck, latched, flapping.\n\nHuman factors: bypass, conflict, error, fatigue, panic, training\u2011gap.\n\nEnvironment: smoke, heat, water, dust, electromagnetic interference.\n\nPower: unavailable, brownout, transfer\u2011fault, battery\u2011depleted, fail\u2011unsafe.\n\nCommunications: unavailable, blocked, desynchronized, overload, priority\u2011inversion, time\u2011source\u2011loss.\n\nCybersecurity: spoofed, tampered, unauthorized, ransomware, service\u2011denial, certificate\u2011expired.\n\nArtificial intelligence and analytics: false\u2011positive, false\u2011negative, drift, bias, stale\u2011model, low\u2011confidence.\n\nControl logic: lockout, deadlock, livelock, heartbeat\u2011timeout, split\u2011brain, watchdog\u2011miss.\n\nMaintenance and operations: latent, miscalibrated, left\u2011in\u2011bypass, version\u2011mismatch, rollback\u2011failure.\n\nSubsystems and high\u2011risk interfaces to apply the canon.\n\nI apply the canon to door hardware and release paths, access control controllers and policy, interlocks and mantraps, turnstiles and speedgates, elevator recall and dispatch, evacuation routing and signage, artificial intelligence fire detection and occupancy sensing, manual release devices, dedicated power with fire trip, network and time synchronization, backup communications, monitoring and audit logging.\n\nPrioritize interfaces: fire alarm to access control, access control to door hardware, fire alarm to elevators, access control to interlocks and turnstiles, routing to signage, artificial intelligence source to event aggregator, network and time to controllers, power to magnetic locks, manual devices to door release.\n\nAuthority and supervision semantics for conflict resolution.\n\nFree egress precedence and fail\u2011unlock by default on loss of power or loss of command; door group authority transfers to the fire alarm on alarm.\n\nLockdown\u2011to\u2011evacuation handover uses a deterministic handshake with a bounded timer; relock only after alarm clear, supervised door closed, time resynchronized, and occupancy safe.\n\nManual egress devices are local, hardwired, supervised, and never blocked by software; logging is mandatory yet never blocking of release.\n\nSafety\u2011critical paths that must act within one hundred milliseconds are local and hardwired; software orchestration may supplement but not replace deterministic releases.\n\nIntegration constraints to guide later what\u2011ifs.\n\nDoor position supervision must gate relock to prevent relock while open.\n\nTime source health and priority must prevent priority inversion and desynchronization during alarms.\n\nInterlock bypass must precede any unlock that would otherwise trap occupants in mantraps or turnstiles.\n\nThe created canon closes material gaps in the creative draft by adding network priority inversion, time source loss, split brain controller conditions, and door position supervision semantics, because these are recurrent failure modes that drive relock during alarm and deadline misses in distributed safety paths.\n\nIt organizes guide words across timing, quantity, quality, routing, sequence, location, duration, human factors, environment, power, communications, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, control logic, and maintenance, therefore it enables consistent what\u2011if generation at the exact interfaces where hazards concentrate.\n\nBecause free egress must dominate any competing objective, the authority semantics assert fail unlock by default, door group authority transfer to the fire alarm during alarm, and a deterministic lockdown to evacuation handover; this steers designs toward local hardwired releases within sub one hundred milliseconds and logging that never blocks safety actions.\n\nHowever, the canon alone does not define quantitative verification, therefore actual data would need to be obtained for latency budgets, availability baselines, and door status telemetry accuracy using time synchronized measurement at the controller relay and the supervised door position sensor.\n\nAdditionally, interactions with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning smoke control and elevator dispatch may warrant deeper decomposition and testable preconditions, although the interfaces are already prioritized here to seed the subsequent hazard enumeration.\n\nConsequently, this canon is ready to drive systematic scenario creation for hazard identification and risk evaluation with the stated matrix, starting with critical egress doors that must prove local sub one hundred millisecond release and supervised, safe relock conditions under alarm clear.",

          "text": "I reviewed the background analysis for the live cutover and present the synthesized baseline, gaps, and required clarifications.\n\nSWIFT Step 2 \u2013 Background Analysis for live cutover\n\nTriggering condition and scope. Because the campus must migrate to an integrated life safety system while remaining occupied and mission critical, the cutover occurs live under zero\u2011downtime tolerance. Therefore the triggering condition is a phased, building\u2011by\u2011building migration with legacy and new systems in parallel and one\u2011way isolation, where each phase enters explicit commissioning states: shadow monitoring, supervised test with bounded authority, and live control with verified handback.\n\nRegulatory and business drivers, authority and impairment governance. Because National Fire Protection Association codes, the International Fire Code, the International Building Code, and Underwriters Laboratories listings require maintained detection, notification, and smoke control during any impairment, and the business mandates continuous cooling and operations, authority must be explicit and auditable. Therefore the authority having jurisdiction, the fire department, and the owner designate incident command, impairment permits, and approved methods of procedure, with timed handovers between fire alarm control responsibility and building management across commissioning states, involving operations, facilities, information technology, the commissioning agent, and the system integrator.\n\nCurrent operational state and continuity constraints. Because legacy fire alarm and building management remain authoritative until formal cutover, while new addressable detection, edge processing, artificial intelligence video analytics, internet of things mesh, automated evacuation, and smoke control interfaces are introduced across more than fifteen buildings and more than ten thousand endpoints, boundaries and timing must be precise. Therefore continuity constraints include end\u2011to\u2011end safety decision latency less than one hundred milliseconds, strict event ordering and time synchronization, supervised smoke control routing, backup communications via radio, distributed antenna system, cellular, and satellite, and power dependency on uninterruptible power systems and generators, with nuisance alarm limits enforced during shadow and supervised test; actual inventory and topology must be verified.\n\nBecause this baseline defines authority handover, impairment governance, and latency and continuity budgets, subsequent guide\u2011word scenarios can be anchored to real constraints rather than assumptions. Therefore any deviation analysis should explicitly reference these commissioning states, ownership boundaries, and budgets.\n\nSWIFT Step 2 \u2013 Background Analysis\n\nTriggering condition and scope. Because the campus must migrate an integrated life safety system while remaining occupied and mission critical, the cutover is live and phased by building with parallel legacy and new systems under one way isolation. Therefore each phase uses stateful commissioning modes: shadow monitoring with zero control, supervised test with bounded authority under impairment permits, and live control with verified handback to operations and the authority having jurisdiction.\n\nRegulatory and business drivers, authority, and impairment governance. Because National Fire Protection Association codes, the International Fire Code, the International Building Code, and Underwriters Laboratories listings require maintained detection, notification, and smoke control during any impairment, governance must be explicit and auditable. Therefore incident command, impairment permits, and approved methods of procedure with timed handovers between fire alarm control panel responsibility and building management must be pre agreed and communicated to emergency responders and site leadership.\n\nCurrent operational state and continuity constraints. Because legacy fire alarm and building management remain authoritative until formal cutover while new addressable detection, edge processing, artificial intelligence video analytics, internet of things mesh, automated evacuation, and smoke control interfaces are introduced across more than fifteen buildings and more than ten thousand endpoints, boundaries and timing must be precise. Therefore continuity constraints include end to end safety decision latency less than one hundred milliseconds on the critical path, hardened event ordering via precise time synchronization, validated cause and effect for smoke control routing, resilient backup communications by radio, distributed antenna system, cellular, and satellite, and assured power via uninterruptible power systems and generators with nuisance alarm limits enforced during commissioning.\n\nGaps and ambiguities requiring decision. Because authority handover is only described at a high level, the exact command chain and minute by minute acceptance criteria per zone remain ambiguous, therefore unassigned control windows could occur. Because latency is stated as a single target, the lack of a component budget and a monitoring plan for jitter and percentiles blocks acceptance, therefore a path budget and observability schema are required. Because time synchronization design and failure behaviors are not specified, grandmaster loss, holdover, and boundary clock roles are unclear, therefore event ordering could fail during faults. Because cross system smoke control and evacuation mappings span legacy and new, cause and effect ownership and test boundaries are not stated, therefore misrouting risk is not bounded.\n\nThe created background analysis is directionally sound, but several decision-blocking ambiguities remain that would undermine a live cutover.\n\nWhile the commissioning states and one way isolation are defined, the control authority handover remains vague at the minute level. Therefore we need a signed roles and responsibilities matrix per zone with time stamped acceptance gates, radio call scripts, and explicit decision rights for each state to prevent unassigned control windows.\n\nWhile the end to end latency requirement is stated, the absence of a component path budget and percentile monitoring renders it untestable. Therefore define per hop allocations for sensing, messaging, inference, control, and actuation with agreed jitter limits and implement synthetic probes and continuous percentile dashboards linked to change freeze criteria.\n\nWhile time synchronization is called out, failure behaviors and hierarchy are not specified, which risks event misordering under fault. Therefore select a precision time protocol profile with two diverse primary time sources, boundary or transparent clock roles, holdover strategy, and a monitored fallback to network time protocol with alarmed drift thresholds and rehearsed failover tests.\n\nWhile smoke control and evacuation integrations are listed, ownership of cross system mapping and test boundaries is unclear, which risks misrouted commands during mixed legacy and new phases. Therefore establish a single source of truth for cause and effect matrices with automated configuration validation, dry run simulation, and geographically segmented canary activation before any authority handback.\n\nWhile resilient communications and power are asserted, coverage, interference, and load transfer behaviors are not evidenced, which weakens continuity claims. Therefore require witnessed tests for radio, distributed antenna system, cellular, and satellite under peak load and power transitions, including generator and inverter modes, with electromagnetic interference observation and preapproved impairment mitigations such as temporary fire watch.\n\nThese clarifications are high priority because they directly bound life safety risk and acceptance readiness. With these additions, the section becomes testable, auditable, and operationally actionable.",

Therefore require physical and logical segregation between safety control and analytics networks, documented unidirectional data flows, listed and isolated gateways, and interlocks that prevent any direct artificial intelligence command path to actuation.\n\nThe one hundred millisecond decision limit is appropriate because life safety sequences are time critical; however there is no defined latency budget, measurement method, or observability. Therefore allocate a segment by segment latency budget, mandate synchronized time across devices, instrument timestamping at each interface, and validate under worst credible load including failover and congestion, with actual test data retained for Authority Having Jurisdiction review.\n\nThe availability target is meaningful because live cutover cannot impair protection; however the measurement scope and common cause controls are undefined. Therefore define the protected function boundary for availability calculation, include brownout ride through and battery autonomy in scope, require independence between redundant power and pathways to avoid common cause failure, and confirm through availability modeling with source data to be obtained.\n\nThe acceptance program is comprehensive because it ties evidence to Authority Having Jurisdiction decisions; however listing integrity across software and firmware updates is not operationalized. Therefore institute an update gate requiring listing impact assessment, vendor attestation, signed packages, secure rollback, and re evaluation when a change could affect a listing, with retention of certificates and change records.\n\nGovernance is emphasized because unmanaged change erodes confidence; however identity and cybersecurity controls are implicit rather than explicit. Therefore require strong initial identity verification, least privilege with role based access control, multi factor authentication for administrators, code signing for all changes, and segmented networks between safety and non safety domains to prevent unauthorized modification.\n\nThese clarifications make compliance and functional safety demonstrable, therefore increasing Authority Having Jurisdiction confidence and preserving listing integrity.",

Therefore success is met when continuous telemetry during each cutover phase evidences these percentiles with no gap periods.\nBecause time ordering drives smoke control logic, Precision Time Protocol holdover and failover shall produce zero event\u2011ordering inversions in witnessed drills. Therefore success is met when ordered event logs and packet captures confirm monotonic sequencing.\n\nSC\u20111 Real\u2011time performance and ordering\nBecause life\u2011safety decisions must be real time and smoke control depends on correct temporal order, end\u2011to\u2011end decision latency shall be percentile ninety\u2011five less than or equal to one hundred milliseconds and percentile ninety\u2011nine less than or equal to one hundred fifty milliseconds during each cutover window, and Precision Time Protocol holdover and failover shall yield zero event\u2011order inversions. Therefore success is met when continuous instrumentation, sequence beacons, and network captures confirm compliance and raise alarms that trigger temporary fire watch upon any breach.\n\nSC\u20112 Availability, supervision, and coverage\nBecause any blind spot is unacceptable, there shall be no loss of detection coverage and zero missed verified alarms at any time. Therefore success is met when supervised heartbeat and test\u2011fire traces show uninterrupted coverage.\nBecause endpoint health underpins trust, supervised endpoint uptime shall be greater than or equal to ninety\u2011nine point nine five percent per building during cutover windows, and nuisance alarms shall be less than or equal to one per twenty\u2011four hours. Therefore success is met when monitoring reports and operator journals corroborate both.\n\nSC\u20112 Coverage, supervision, nuisance, and enrollment hygiene\nBecause any blind spot is unacceptable, there shall be no loss of detection coverage, zero missed verified alarms, supervised endpoint uptime greater than or equal to ninety\u2011nine point nine five percent per building, and nuisance alarms less than or equal to one per twenty\u2011four hours. Therefore success is met when heartbeat traces, witnessed fire tests, and operator journals corroborate all metrics during each cutover window. Because mass enrollment can destabilize operations, onboarding shall be gated by whitelists with zero unauthorized devices and zero address conflicts; therefore success is met when enrollment audits report clean.\n\nSC\u20113 Control sequences, interlocks, and routing\nBecause incorrect actuation is hazardous, one hundred percent of smoke control cause\u2011and\u2011effect sequences shall pass witnessed testing, and all interfaces shall default to safe\u2011state on loss of communication. Therefore success is met when signed Integrated System Test records and replayable logs show correct actuation.\nBecause phased work risks misrouting, evacuation messaging and routing shall be correct by zone with cross\u2011building broadcasts inhibited until the receiving building is accepted. Therefore success is met when dry\u2011run pages and live tests match zone maps.\n\nSC\u20113 Control sequences, routing, safe\u2011state, and failover\nBecause incorrect actuation is hazardous, one hundred percent of smoke control cause\u2011and\u2011effect sequences shall pass witnessed testing, zone\u2011targeted notification shall be correct with cross\u2011building broadcasts inhibited until the receiving building is accepted, and all interfaces shall fail to safe state on loss of communication. Therefore success is met when signed Integrated System Test records and replayable logs show correct actuation and backup communications failover carries alarms without loss while meeting the latency objective.\n\nSC\u20114 Commissioning gates aligned to handovers\nPre\u2011cutover: approved Method of Procedure and Standard Operating Procedure, signed golden configuration, and timed, tested rollback.\nParallel\u2011run: one\u2011way isolation between legacy and new, artificial intelligence in shadow mode with threshold gating, and no duplicate public notifications.\nBuilding cutover: Authority Having Jurisdiction witnessed tests, temporary fire watch if any impairment occurs, and rollback readiness.\nStabilization and campus acceptance: sustained metrics above, as\u2011builts and training delivered, and Authority Having Jurisdiction sign\u2011off.\n\nSC\u20114 Commissioning gates and change control\nBecause parallel operations raise coupling risk, legacy and new shall run in parallel under one\u2011way isolation with artificial intelligence in shadow mode and no duplicate public notifications; all changes shall execute under approved Method of Procedure and Standard Operating Procedure with proven, timed rollback. Therefore success is met when the Authority Having Jurisdiction witnesses building acceptance and temporary fire watch is activated upon any impairment.\n\nSC\u20115 Evidence, compliance, and listings\nBecause code and listings constrain design, all components and analytics shall operate within their listings and certifications; any deviation shall have prior written Authority Having Jurisdiction approval. Therefore success is met when submittals, certificates, signed test artifacts, and immutable telemetry are archived for audit. What gaps do you see?\n\nSC\u20115 Evidence, listing compliance, and auditability\nBecause code and listings constrain design and proof must be durable, all components and analytics shall operate within their listings and certifications or have prior written approval. Therefore success is met when submittals, certificates, signed test artifacts, immutable telemetry, as\u2011builts, training, and enrollment audits are archived and traceable for audit.\n\nThe section establishes clear, safety\u2011first acceptance gates, and this is strong because it links latency, coverage, sequencing, and change control to observable evidence. However, the real\u2011time targets risk being unenforceable without explicit network path budgets and quality of service guarantees, since percentiles alone do not constrain per\u2011segment jitter. Therefore, add per\u2011hop latency and jitter budgets, continuous synthetic probes on each critical path, and automatic impairment escalation to temporary fire watch when tails degrade.\n\nThe backup communications requirement states pass\u2011through under latency objectives, yet it omits explicit failover testing gates and steady\u2011state monitoring for non\u2011primary paths. Because radio, distributed antenna, cellular, and satellite exhibit different loss and delay behaviors, require witnessed switchover drills, steady\u2011state tail tracking on backups, and alarms when backup performance risks breaching decision latency; actual thresholds for each bearer would need to be obtained.\n\nArtificial intelligence is gated to shadow mode, which is prudent, but the criteria do not bound false\u2011positive and false\u2011negative rates by data domain. Because commissioning environments shift rapidly, include dataset version control, drift detection, and acceptance gates that require stable false\u2011positive trends below the nuisance threshold across representative hot work and construction scenarios; the exact acceptable rates require verification.\n\nTime synchronization success is defined as zero ordering inversions, yet the absence of maximum time error budgets and holdover limits weakens assurance. Therefore, specify maximum permissible time error at edge and core, define holdover duration alarms, and require multi\u2011source time with deterministic tie\u2011breaking, then verify with ordered beacons during power and network perturbations.\n\nSecurity and infrastructure hygiene are implied but not formalized into gates. Because life\u2011safety traffic depends on underlying routers and firewalls, add dedicated segment availability targets higher than enterprise baselines, vulnerability scanning coverage and timely remediation ahead of cutover, certificate and key validity checks, and change\u2011freeze windows aligning with commissioning.\n\nWith these augmentations, evidence becomes more auditable, residual risk is reduced, and the criteria align better to end\u2011to\u2011end causality.",

This supports the Background and Success Criteria by grounding them in concrete topology and trust boundaries; however, it challenges any assumption that the network can be treated as generic enterprise fabric by requiring explicit safety segmentation, time hierarchy, and out\u2011of\u2011band failover details."

Because this path must be deterministic, it is isolated in its own virtual routing and forwarding instance with allowlisted protocols only. Therefore, only life\u2011safety topics and control flows are permitted.\nEdge Analytics Zone: cameras and inference nodes. Because video is high volume and non\u2011deterministic, only event metadata crosses to brokers; raw video stays local unless for forensics.\nBroker and Controller Zone: active\u2011active message brokers and life\u2011safety controllers in two diverse facilities. Because this is the decision core, it has redundant links and storage, plus stateful failover.\nTime Authority Zone: dual Global Navigation Satellite System\u2011sourced grandmasters; boundary clocks at each building distribution; tertiary Network Time Protocol. Because time drives sequencing, offsets and jitter are monitored with alarms and automatic grandmaster switchover.\nManagement and Identity Zone: certificate authority, enrollment, revocation, network access control, secure firmware services. Therefore, onboarding and lifecycle are separated from runtime paths.\nIntegration Zone: building systems interfaces (heating, ventilation, air conditioning, access), strictly via secured conduits.\nMonitoring and Incident Response Zone: intrusion detection, flow telemetry, logging, orchestration.\nBackup Communications Zone: cellular and low power wide area network gateways, physically diverse and power\u2011independent.\n\nKey conduits and interfaces (allowlist)\nSafety gateway to broker: Message Queuing Telemetry Transport over mutual Transport Layer Security, quality of service set for single retransmit, retained events disabled for alarms.\nBroker to controller and controller to Safety Control Zone: prioritized control topics; command rate limiting.\nIntegration Zone: Building Automation and Control Network Secure Connect or Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture with mutual Transport Layer Security; one\u2011way policies where feasible.\nTime: Precision Time Protocol end\u2011to\u2011end with boundary clocks; offset and path delay export to monitoring.\nManagement: Enrollment over secure transport with local caching; revocation via stapled status and cached lists.\n\nDeterministic transport and budgets\nWithin buildings: Time Sensitive Networking on access and distribution; per\u2011stream filtering and policing; expedited forwarding for safety traffic; storm control.\nCampus core: strict low\u2011latency queue for safety; equal\u2011cost multipath with fast failure detection.\nTestable latency budget targets (P95, ranges; exacts to be verified): sensor to edge 5\u201315 ms; edge to broker 10\u201320 ms; broker to controller 5\u201315 ms; controller to actuator 10\u201320 ms; aggregate within the defined success criteria.\n\nBackup bearers\nCellular carries only minimal, signed alarm topics and heartbeats because bandwidth and latency vary; maximum transmission unit, session resumption, and health checks are pre\u2011validated; automatic switchover and return with hold\u2011down timers.\n\nCutover mechanics\nDual\u2011plane operation with parallel Safety Control Zone fabric; pre\u2011provisioned certificates and multi\u2011authentication; mirrored taps for pre\u2011cutover validation; deterministic queues pre\u2011tested under synthetic alarm storms; documented rollback.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 System Description: Architecture baseline for hazard mapping\n\nBoundaries and trust zones\nSafety Control Zone: Because life\u2011safety paths must be deterministic, this zone contains detectors, panels, notification devices, actuators, and safety gateways within dedicated virtual routing and forwarding with protocol allowlisting; therefore only life\u2011safety topics and control flows traverse it.\nEdge Analytics Zone: Because video is high volume and nondeterministic, cameras and inference nodes emit only signed event metadata to brokers while raw video remains local except for forensics.\nBroker and Controller Zone: Because it is the decision core, active\u2011active brokers and controllers operate in two facilities with redundant links and stateful failover.\nTime Authority Zone: Because time drives ordering, dual Global Navigation Satellite System grandmasters feed building boundary clocks using Precision Time Protocol with tertiary Network Time Protocol, and offset and jitter alarms trigger automatic switchover.\nManagement and Identity Zone: Because runtime must be separated from lifecycle, certificate authority, enrollment and revocation, network access control, and secure firmware services are isolated from data paths.\nIntegration and Monitoring Zone: Because coupling and visibility must be controlled, building system interfaces traverse secured conduits with one\u2011way policies where feasible, and intrusion detection, flow telemetry, and logging use read\u2011only taps.\nBackup Communications Zone: Because power and path independence are required, cellular and low\u2011power wide\u2011area gateways are diverse and hardened, and they carry only minimal signed alarms and heartbeats.\n\nInputs and outputs\nInputs: sensor telemetry and video\u2011analytics events on prioritized topics.\nOutputs: control commands to actuators and alarms to occupants and responders.\n\nKey conduits and interfaces\nSafety gateway to broker: Because retransmissions add delay, publishing uses Message Queuing Telemetry Transport over mutual Transport Layer Security with single retransmit quality of service and no retained alarms; therefore queue growth is bounded.\nBroker to controller to Safety Control Zone: Because commands must preempt background, prioritized topics and command rate limits are enforced.\nIntegration interfaces: Because cross\u2011domain exposure must be minimized, Building Automation and Control Network Secure Connect or Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture run over mutual Transport Layer Security with one\u2011way policies where feasible.\nTime distribution: Because ordering depends on time, Precision Time Protocol runs end\u2011to\u2011end with boundary clocks, and offset and path\u2011delay telemetry feed monitoring.\nManagement plane: Because revocation reachability can fail, certificate enrollment uses secure transport with local caches, and status is delivered by stapling and cached lists.\n\nDeterministic transport and budgets\nBuildings: Because endpoints require predictability, access and distribution implement Time Sensitive Networking with per\u2011stream filtering and policing, expedited forwarding for safety, and storm control.\nCampus core: Because Time Sensitive Networking is impractical end\u2011to\u2011end, the campus core provides strict low\u2011latency queues, equal\u2011cost multipath, and fast convergence using bidirectional forwarding detection.\nLatency targets for validation: Because the objective is less than one hundred milliseconds end\u2011to\u2011end, testable P\u2011ninety\u2011five targets are sensor to edge ten to twenty milliseconds, edge to broker ten to twenty milliseconds, broker to controller five to fifteen milliseconds, and controller to actuator ten to twenty milliseconds; actual data would need to be obtained during testing.\n\nCutover mechanics\nBecause live cutover must maintain protection, a dual\u2011plane fabric runs in parallel with pre\u2011provisioned certificates and multiple authentication, mirrored taps validate flows, queues are pre\u2011tested with synthetic alarm storms, and a documented rollback is ready.\n\nWhile the design assigns strict priority to safety traffic, it omits explicit class definitions, per flow limits, and queue preemption behavior. Therefore we should enumerate traffic classes, scheduling method, queue depths, shaper and policer rates, and Differentiated Services Code Point mappings, with acceptance thresholds tied to the latency and jitter budgets.\n\nWhile single retransmit and no retained alarms reduce delay, they risk event loss during broker or link failover and can undermine completeness. Therefore define end to end delivery assurance for safety topics, including publisher retry windows, broker replication quorum and split brain handling, consumer idempotency, and measured recovery time during stateful failover.\n\nWhile dual satellite grandmasters and boundary clocks are strong, fallback and profile compatibility across vendors remain under specified. Therefore codify the Precision Time Protocol profile, loss of lock alarms, holdover quality targets, automatic re convergence timing, and maximum acceptable time offset for safety decisions.\n\nWhile cached revocation and stapled status mitigate reachability loss, large scale issuance and rotation could starve constrained gateways and cause stale trust. Therefore quantify certificate throughput and storage, define enrollment resiliency when the management plane is isolated, enforce device attestation and secure boot, and test failure modes with expired or revoked identities.\n\nWhile backup bearers carry minimal alarms, maximum transmission unit mismatch, radio congestion, and asymmetric routing can inflate latency or reorder events. Therefore pre compute maximum payload sizes, validate session resumption and fragmentation behavior under realistic radio conditions, gate failover with health thresholds and hold down timers, and execute live drills with mirrored taps and rollback criteria.\n\nThis strengthens the section for hazard mapping because it links mechanisms to measurable thresholds, and it surfaces where actual data would need to be obtained to prove the less than one hundred millisecond objective. Therefore these clarifications are necessary to make the architecture testable, defensible, and ready for systematic guide word application.",

        "text": "For SWIFT Step 1, I propose three domain-specific guide-word clusters to anchor all later what-if generation. Because the system must act in less than one hundred milliseconds and remain stable during change, these emphasize temporal integrity, perception fidelity, and fusion-to-actuation correctness.\n\n1) Temporal integrity under hard real time\nBecause late or disordered signals skew fusion, include: early, late, variable delay, jitter, burst, timeout, deadline miss, clock drift or skew, buffering lag, backlog, out-of-order, duplication, gap or drop, replay during failover, conflicting timestamps. Therefore we expose hazards where temporal smoothing windows, hysteresis, or debouncing are mismatched to rapid-onset flame or smoke growth.\n\n2) Perception fidelity, drift, and environmental confounders\nBecause false positives during commissioning and missed detections often arise from input quality, include: wrong, noisy, biased, uncalibrated, drifted, stale, adversarial patterning; and environment: haze, dust, steam, glare, reflections, strobing lights, lens contamination, focus shift, occlusion, scene clutter. Since quantity can degrade perception, also include: more or less frames, saturation, overflow, compression artifacts, loss. Therefore we systematically probe conditions where construction activity, hot aisle shimmer, or cleaning practices mimic smoke, flame, or people.\n\n3) Fusion, state management, and actuation integrity\nBecause incorrect state or routing can misdrive heating ventilation and air conditioning and evacuation, include sequence or state: wrong state, partial cutover, rollback, failover with stale models, threshold mismatch, race, stuck; direction or flow: misrouted, blocked, broadcast leakage, duplicated; human factors: mislabel, misconfigure, override, threshold creep, fatigue, cognitive overload; security-adjacent robustness: spoofed frames, integrity bypass, model tampering, dataset contamination. Therefore we capture hazards where low-confidence analytics trigger interlocks, or cross-modal gates suppress genuine alarms.\n\nWhat gaps do you see, especially regarding data governance during on-site fine tuning and cross-clock alignment across vendors?\n\nSWIFT Step 1 \u2013 Canonical guide words for AI fire detection and analytics\n\nWhile the three proposed clusters are strong, they under-specify cross-system timebase alignment and data governance during on\u2011site fine\u2011tuning, which materially drive both false alarms and missed detections. Therefore, the following canonical sets will anchor all subsequent what\u2011if work across components and vendors.\n\nTiming and timebase alignment: Because fusion correctness depends on temporal coherence under one hundred milliseconds, include early, late, variable delay, jitter, burst, timeout, deadline miss, clock skew and drift across vendors, timestamp format mismatch, step changes during resynchronization, backlog accumulation, replay during failover, and out\u2011of\u2011order arrivals.\n\nQuantity and load: Because congestion distorts perception and fusion, include none, more, less, overflow, saturation, drop, frame rate throttling under contention, Internet of Things event storms that amplify upstream, duplicate retries that inflate counts, and rate limiting that truncates critical evidence.\n\nQuality and robustness: Because input fidelity governs precision and recall, include wrong class, noisy, biased, uncalibrated, drifted, stale model or calibration, adversarial flicker or patterning, compression artifacts at low bitrate, occlusion or lens contamination, thermal shimmer near hot aisles, sensor saturation, and spoofed or replayed frames that pass weak integrity checks.\n\nDirection and flow control: Because routing determines which logic acts, include misrouted streams after network change, blocked priority paths under quality of service shifts, duplicated or retained messages replayed on reconnect, broadcast leakage across zones, and out\u2011of\u2011order delivery that defeats temporal guards.\n\nSequence and state management: Because mixed modes create latent hazards, include wrong state, partial cutover mismatch, race or stuck states, rollback or failover with stale calibration, inconsistent thresholds across instances, test or maintenance suppressions, and mode confusion between simulation and live.\n\nEnvironment and external conditions: Because scenes vary in the field, include smoke\u2011like steam or fog, dust and construction haze, glare and reflections, strobing lighting, vibration and camera shift, airflow patterns that divert smoke, and cleaning practices that introduce visual artifacts.\n\nHuman and governance factors: Because people and process shape risk, include mislabel during on\u2011site tuning, misconfiguration and threshold creep to silence nuisance alerts, fatigue during multi\u2011alarm storms, dataset provenance and consent gaps, contaminated fine\u2011tune sets, weak versioning and approval of models and thresholds, and missing shadow\u2011mode acceptance gates.\n\n1) Because cross vendor clocks drift and failover reorders events, fusion can misplace alarms or suppress real ones, therefore heating ventilation and air conditioning and evacuation commands may conflict. Given brittle time bases and sub one hundred millisecond deadlines, Likelihood four, Impact five, Risk twenty high, mitigate before go live. However, current safeguards use network time synchronization, yet they do not ensure temporal consensus. Therefore, recommend Precision Time Protocol with hardware timestamping, cross stream coherence checks, two modality temporal gating, and fallback to conventional detectors aligned with life safety codes. Consequently, residual Likelihood two, Impact four, Risk eight.\n\n2) Because on site fine tuning often uses opportunistic footage under dust, glare, and steam, the model can learn to suppress true smoke or flame, therefore missed detection rises when nuisance pressure is highest. Given commissioning variability and limited holdout validation, Likelihood three, Impact five, Risk fifteen. However, current safeguards include vendor locked models and acceptance tests, yet governance is frequently informal. Therefore, recommend strict data lineage and approval, signed training data, shadow mode gates, synthetic smoke benchmarks, out of distribution alarms, and do not relax fusion thresholds without two independent sensors. Consequently, residual Likelihood two, Impact four, Risk eight.\n\n3) Because occupancy inference and smoke prediction can err under occlusion, privacy masking, or sensor drop, dynamic signage may route occupants toward hazardous corridors, therefore automation can create harm greater than a static plan. Given model generalization limits and field variability, Likelihood three, Impact five, Risk fifteen. However, current safeguards include static egress plans and human wardens, yet automated routing may override without guard rails. Therefore, recommend multi source validation for route changes, invariant prohibition on routing through unconfirmed hazard zones, uncertainty based fallback to static plans, and operator confirmation for major reroutes. Consequently, residual Likelihood two, Impact five, Risk ten.\n\nWhat gaps do you see, and which assumptions need stress tests?\n\nSWIFT Step 1 \u2013 Domain\u2011specific guide words for artificial intelligence fire detection and analytics\n\nThe creative clusters are a strong start; however they underweight cross\u2011vendor timebase alignment and formal data governance during on\u2011site fine tuning, which repeatedly drive misdetections and nuisance alarms. Therefore the following focused sets will anchor all subsequent what\u2011if generation across components and vendors.\n\nTiming and timebase alignment: Because fusion must be temporally coherent under one hundred milliseconds across vendors, include early, late, variable delay, jitter, burst, timeout, deadline miss, clock drift and skew, timestamp mismatch, resynchronization steps, backlog buildup, replay during failover, and out of order arrival. Therefore scenarios will pressure test smoothing, hysteresis, and debouncing windows.\n\nPerception fidelity and environmental confounders: Because perception errors drive both false alarms and missed detections during commissioning, include wrong class, noisy, biased, uncalibrated, drifted, stale models, compression artifacts, occlusion, lens contamination, glare, reflections, strobing lights, steam, dust, haze, thermal shimmer, and adversarial visual patterns. Therefore we will probe construction, cleaning, and hot aisle conditions.\n\nQuantity and load: Because congestion and compute contention distort evidence flow, include none, more, less, overflow, saturation, drops, frame rate throttling, event storms, duplicate retries, and rate limiting that truncates critical context windows. Therefore we will examine headroom, backpressure, and prioritization of life safety traffic.\n\nSequence, cutover, and failover state integrity: Because mixed modes and routing mistakes can misdrive heating ventilation and air conditioning and evacuation, include wrong state, partial cutover, rollback, failover with stale calibration, threshold mismatch, race, stuck, misrouted or blocked streams, duplication, and broadcast leakage across zones. Therefore interlocks and mode protections must be explicit.\n\nHuman and governance factors for data and thresholds: Because hurried tuning and nuisance pressure corrupt model behavior, include mislabel during on\u2011site fine tuning, misconfiguration, threshold creep, operator override, fatigue, dataset provenance gaps, contaminated training sets, weak versioning, unsigned artifacts, and missing shadow\u2011mode acceptance gates. Therefore approvals and conservative fallbacks must be enforced.\n\nThe created section intentionally challenges the creative clusters by stating that cross vendor timebase alignment and formal data governance were underweighted, because these factors routinely cause fusion errors and governance drift during commissioning. Therefore, it elevates timing coherence and data lineage to first class guide words that will systematically surface hazards with real consequence.\n\nIt structures the guide words across timing, quantity, quality, direction and flow, sequence and state, environment, and human and governance, because comprehensive coverage prevents blind spots during what if generation across cameras, inference, fusion, and actuation. Therefore, it directly supports later scenario building for peak load, partial cutover, and commissioning conditions without requiring rework.\n\nIt deepens the timing set to include clock skew, resynchronization steps, backlog buildup, and out of order arrivals, because these specific mechanisms explain why debouncing and hysteresis fail under less than one hundred millisecond deadlines. Therefore, it creates a traceable link between temporal faults and misdriven heating ventilation and air conditioning or evacuation logic.\n\nIt expands perception fidelity to include compression artifacts, lens contamination, thermal shimmer, and adversarial patterns, because these are repeatedly observed sources of false positives and missed detections during construction and cleaning. Therefore, environmental variability is explicitly integrated into later tests and acceptance gates.\n\nIt adds governance items such as dataset provenance gaps, unsigned artifacts, and missing shadow mode gates, because hurried on site fine tuning often degrades safety performance under nuisance pressure. Therefore, model and threshold changes will be constrained by process controls during migration.\n\nLimitations remain where actual distributions and rates are required, because latency tails, drop rates, calibration stability, and drift magnitudes are site dependent. Therefore, actual data would need to be obtained to parameterize thresholds, capacity headroom, and acceptance criteria.",

Because smoke control actuators have inertia, fail positions, and dwell requirements, we elevated timing \u201cNo or None\u201d and sequencing terms to capture absent or withheld actions explicitly.\n\nWe strengthened governance because multi-master conflicts are a recurrent root cause. Therefore we added priority inversion, unauthorized writes, and manual hand\u2013off\u2013auto mispositioning to force scenarios where firefighter smoke control panel must preempt analytics and building automation writes.\n\nThe inclusion of end switch failed and proof of flow missing is deliberate because feedback plausibility, not just command issuance, determines containment. Consequently, we can generate scenarios where a fan proves status without airflow, which has occurred in practice, with source verification required.\n\nWe expanded direction and path with bypass open and short circuit because field bypasses and mis-set reliefs can collapse pressure differentials. Additionally, door force exceeded anchors the pressure targets to egress usability so the analysis connects airflow to human operability.\n\nWe added ride through failed, brownout, and transient because automatic transfer switching and generator stabilization often trip variable drives. Therefore, we will evaluate start sequencing and minimum off times against less than one hundred millisecond command budgets that controls must meet.\n\nWhile some may argue \u201cNo or None\u201d duplicates \u201cOmitted\u201d, it captures dead controllers and missing heartbeats on networks, which is diagnostically distinct. Likewise, some may place door force only in acceptance testing; however, embedding it at guide-word level aligns scenarios with code-constrained outcomes.\n\nThe subsystem mapping is intentionally broad because cross-building propagation, time synchronization, and inter-building routing create latent, simultaneous, and out-of-sequence risks. Therefore we called out desynchronized time and heartbeat lost to bind latency and integrity to operability.\n\nData gaps remain and require verification: end-to-end latency measurements, network quality of service and virtual local area network isolation, authoritative write matrix, sensor placement details, and measured door opening forces under load. These items must be evidenced before scenario scoring.",

therefore only life\u2011safety topics and control flows traverse it.\nEdge Analytics Zone: Because video is high volume and nondeterministic, cameras and inference nodes emit only signed event metadata to brokers while raw video remains local except for forensics.\nBroker and Controller Zone: Because it is the decision core, active\u2011active brokers and controllers operate in two facilities with redundant links and stateful failover.\nTime Authority Zone: Because time drives ordering, dual Global Navigation Satellite System grandmasters feed building boundary clocks using Precision Time Protocol with tertiary Network Time Protocol, and offset and jitter alarms trigger automatic switchover.\nManagement and Identity Zone: Because runtime must be separated from lifecycle, certificate authority, enrollment and revocation, network access control, and secure firmware services are isolated from data paths.\nIntegration and Monitoring Zone: Because coupling and visibility must be controlled, building system interfaces traverse secured conduits with one\u2011way policies where feasible, and intrusion detection, flow telemetry, and logging use read\u2011only taps.\nBackup Communications Zone: Because power and path independence are required, cellular and low\u2011power wide\u2011area gateways are diverse and hardened, and they carry only minimal signed alarms and heartbeats.\n\nInputs and outputs\nInputs: sensor telemetry and video\u2011analytics events on prioritized topics.\nOutputs: control commands to actuators and alarms to occupants and responders.\n\nKey conduits and interfaces\nSafety gateway to broker: Because retransmissions add delay, publishing uses Message Queuing Telemetry Transport over mutual Transport Layer Security with single retransmit quality of service and no retained alarms; therefore queue growth is bounded.\nBroker to controller to Safety Control Zone: Because commands must preempt background, prioritized topics and command rate limits are enforced.\nIntegration interfaces: Because cross\u2011domain exposure must be minimized, Building Automation and Control Network Secure Connect or Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture run over mutual Transport Layer Security with one\u2011way policies where feasible.\nTime distribution: Because ordering depends on time, Precision Time Protocol runs end\u2011to\u2011end with boundary clocks, and offset and path\u2011delay telemetry feed monitoring.\nManagement plane: Because revocation reachability can fail, certificate enrollment uses secure transport with local caches, and status is delivered by stapling and cached lists.\n\nDeterministic transport and budgets\nBuildings: Because endpoints require predictability, access and distribution implement Time Sensitive Networking with per\u2011stream filtering and policing, expedited forwarding for safety, and storm control.\nCampus core: Because Time Sensitive Networking is impractical end\u2011to\u2011end, the campus core provides strict low\u2011latency queues, equal\u2011cost multipath, and fast convergence using bidirectional forwarding detection.\nLatency targets for validation: Because the objective is less than one hundred milliseconds end\u2011to\u2011end, testable P\u2011ninety\u2011five targets are sensor to edge ten to twenty milliseconds, edge to broker ten to twenty milliseconds, broker to controller five to fifteen milliseconds, and controller to actuator ten to twenty milliseconds; actual data would need to be obtained during testing.\n\nCutover mechanics\nBecause live cutover must maintain protection, a dual\u2011plane fabric runs in parallel with pre\u2011provisioned certificates and multiple authentication, mirrored taps validate flows, queues are pre\u2011tested with synthetic alarm storms, and a documented rollback is ready.\n\nWhile the design assigns strict priority to safety traffic, it omits explicit class definitions, per flow limits, and queue preemption behavior. Therefore we should enumerate traffic classes, scheduling method, queue depths, shaper and policer rates, and Differentiated Services Code Point mappings, with acceptance thresholds tied to the latency and jitter budgets.\n\nWhile single retransmit and no retained alarms reduce delay, they risk event loss during broker or link failover and can undermine completeness. Therefore define end to end delivery assurance for safety topics, including publisher retry windows, broker replication quorum and split brain handling, consumer idempotency, and measured recovery time during stateful failover.\n\nWhile dual satellite grandmasters and boundary clocks are strong, fallback and profile compatibility across vendors remain under specified. Therefore codify the Precision Time Protocol profile, loss of lock alarms, holdover quality targets, automatic re convergence timing, and maximum acceptable time offset for safety decisions.\n\nWhile cached revocation and stapled status mitigate reachability loss, large scale issuance and rotation could starve constrained gateways and cause stale trust. Therefore quantify certificate throughput and storage, define enrollment resiliency when the management plane is isolated, enforce device attestation and secure boot, and test failure modes with expired or revoked identities.\n\nWhile backup bearers carry minimal alarms, maximum transmission unit mismatch, radio congestion, and asymmetric routing can inflate latency or reorder events. Therefore pre compute maximum payload sizes, validate session resumption and fragmentation behavior under realistic radio conditions, gate failover with health thresholds and hold down timers, and execute live drills with mirrored taps and rollback criteria.\n\nThis strengthens the section for hazard mapping because it links mechanisms to measurable thresholds, and it surfaces where actual data would need to be obtained to prove the less than one hundred millisecond objective. Therefore these clarifications are necessary to make the architecture testable, defensible, and ready for systematic guide word application.",

However, it under-specifies operator confirmation gating for high-consequence state changes, which matters because unauthorized or erroneous re-route flips can create contradictory cues.\n\nThe routing defaults are sensible because falling back to static egress limits misdirection under low confidence. Nevertheless, without hysteresis and hold-times, arrows can oscillate during marginal sensor states, therefore an anti-flap rule, minimum dwell, and suppression rather than rapid reversal should be added.\n\nThe intelligibility focus is appropriate because mechanical noise and reverberation degrade comprehension. Yet, the mapping does not explicitly bind message length, language selection logic, and acoustic priority to latency budgets, therefore include constraints on message duration, deterministic language routing, and preemption rules traceable to the specified performance targets.\n\nThe human behavior section is useful because it recognizes clustering and habitual exit bias. Still, accessibility and refuge specifics are too general, therefore add guide words for assistance dispatch failure, refuge two-way communication failure, evacuation chair unavailability, and door hardware force exceedance under load.\n\nInterfaces are covered broadly because lost links and unsynchronized states are listed. While that is helpful, backup communication paths and radio systems deserve explicit guide words for stairwell coverage gaps, quality of service prioritization failure, and battery autonomy shortfall during extended events.\n\nSecurity and cutover hazards are acknowledged because spoofing and test mode are named. However, mobile notification misuse and multilingual mapping errors are not explicit, therefore add guide words for wrong geofence, wrong language package, and misaligned building-to-building zone mapping during campus-wide events.\n\nFinally, cross-system impacts need one more lens because heating, ventilation, and air conditioning smoke control sequencing changes ambient noise and door pressures. Therefore, add guide words for sequence misalignment that increases noise during announcements and door force spikes that stall egress.",

Therefore we adopt it with targeted extensions and clarifications and declare this list a mandatory checklist for all components.\n\nGuide word categories and canonical set\nTiming: use early, late, jitter, preempted, priority inversion, garbage collection pause, reset stall, interrupt moderation, and deadline miss budget exhausted, because these directly breach deterministic timing.\nQuantity: use more, less, none, overflow, underflow, burst, queue growth, and backpressure, because saturation and depletion create hidden latency.\nQuality: use noisy, corrupted, degraded, out of specification, timestamp drift, and clock skew, because fidelity and temporal accuracy govern inference and control.\nDirection: use wrong path, wrong node, wrong interface, wrong topic or partition, wrong queue, and schema mismatch, because misrouting silently bypasses safety consumers.\nSequence: use out of order, skipped, repeated, duplicated, stale, and replayed, because temporal windows and debouncing logic break.\nHuman factors: use misconfigured, overridden, untrained, fatigued, and blinded by alerts, because operational pressure reintroduces nondeterminism.\nInterfaces: use incompatible, version drift, application binary interface break, driver to kernel mismatch, and codec mismatch, because upgrades silently break data and execution paths.\nEnvironment: use overheat, brownout, vibration, electromagnetic interference, and thermal throttling headroom exhausted, because derating induces stalls and resets.\nResilience: use failover slow, failover never, degraded, cold start, split brain, and orchestration reschedule jitter, because continuity hinges on fast and ordered recovery.\nSecurity performance: use throttled by control, denial of service, resource starvation, endpoint scan contention, encryption overhead, and sidecar interference, because controls contend with safety workloads.\nMaintenance: use patched, live migrated, rollback failed, feature flag drift, and model load increase, because change alters timing budgets.\n\nSubsystem mapping checklist (apply all guide words)\nEdge compute nodes and operating system: emphasize interrupt paths, power states, non uniform memory access locality, and cache effects, because these shape worst case latency.\nAccelerators and their schedulers: emphasize graphics processing unit preemption, memory pressure, context resets, and driver updates, because scheduler behavior dominates inference determinism.\nNetworking fabric, message bus, and video ingest: emphasize backpressure and queueing, head of line blocking, codec negotiation, and topic or partition correctness, because these govern end to end flow.\nTime synchronization and clocks: emphasize bounded offset monitoring, hardware timestamping health, and monotonic clock usage, because causality and ordering depend on time integrity.\nOrchestration and failover: emphasize cold start delay, eviction or admission jitter, image pull stalls, and state handoff, because rescheduling threatens the sub one hundred millisecond objective.\n\nI note that The section deliberately critiques and extends the creative draft because several latent tail-latency drivers were underweighted. Specifically, backpressure, accelerator scheduler behavior, orchestration admission delays, and time synchronization edge cases routinely create deadline breaches; therefore these were promoted to first-class guide words.\n\nI note that Because deterministic behavior depends on explicit slack management, we added \u201cdeadline miss budget exhausted\u201d and \u201cinterrupt moderation\u201d under timing. These capture driver coalescing and slack depletion that frequently break the sub one hundred millisecond objective.\n\nI note that Although quantity hazards were listed, the original set did not force discovery of latent queue growth. Therefore we added queue growth and backpressure so flow control can be audited end to end rather than inferred indirectly. Since inference correctness hinges on temporal fidelity, we added timestamp drift and clock skew under quality, because these cause out-of-order windows and false positives.\n\nI note that While direction and interface risks existed, schema mismatch was implicit rather than explicit. Therefore it is now called out to compel contract verification for messages and codecs. Because recovery can itself create jitter, we added orchestration reschedule jitter under resilience to link rescheduling to safety deadlines.\n\nI state that The subsystem mapping consolidates network, message bus, and video ingest as a single flow-control path, since head-of-line blocking and negotiation span these layers. However, to avoid overlap with content-focused domains, we bound this to latency and ordering, not semantics.\n\nI note that Some may contend model complexity dominates latency, yet field traces often show scheduler stalls and queueing dominate the ninety ninth percentile. Therefore we propose high-resolution tracing and partitioned experiments to apportion contributions, with actual data to be obtained.\n\nI emphasize that We surfaced non uniform memory access and cache locality because these drive worst-case latency on multicore edge nodes; consequently the checklist now motivates explicit pinning and locality validation. A residual concern is dynamic frequency scaling and thermal derating; we address this via \u201cthermal throttling headroom exhausted\u201d to enforce monitoring and guards.",

Therefore success is met when continuous telemetry during each cutover phase evidences these percentiles with no gap periods.\nBecause time ordering drives smoke control logic, Precision Time Protocol holdover and failover shall produce zero event\u2011ordering inversions in witnessed drills. Therefore success is met when ordered event logs and packet captures confirm monotonic sequencing.\n\nSC\u20111 Real\u2011time performance and ordering\nBecause life\u2011safety decisions must be real time and smoke control depends on correct temporal order, end\u2011to\u2011end decision latency shall be percentile ninety\u2011five less than or equal to one hundred milliseconds and percentile ninety\u2011nine less than or equal to one hundred fifty milliseconds during each cutover window, and Precision Time Protocol holdover and failover shall yield zero event\u2011order inversions. Therefore success is met when continuous instrumentation, sequence beacons, and network captures confirm compliance and raise alarms that trigger temporary fire watch upon any breach.\n\nSC\u20112 Availability, supervision, and coverage\nBecause any blind spot is unacceptable, there shall be no loss of detection coverage and zero missed verified alarms at any time. Therefore success is met when supervised heartbeat and test\u2011fire traces show uninterrupted coverage.\nBecause endpoint health underpins trust, supervised endpoint uptime shall be greater than or equal to ninety\u2011nine point nine five percent per building during cutover windows, and nuisance alarms shall be less than or equal to one per twenty\u2011four hours. Therefore success is met when monitoring reports and operator journals corroborate both.\n\nSC\u20112 Coverage, supervision, nuisance, and enrollment hygiene\nBecause any blind spot is unacceptable, there shall be no loss of detection coverage, zero missed verified alarms, supervised endpoint uptime greater than or equal to ninety\u2011nine point nine five percent per building, and nuisance alarms less than or equal to one per twenty\u2011four hours. Therefore success is met when heartbeat traces, witnessed fire tests, and operator journals corroborate all metrics during each cutover window. Because mass enrollment can destabilize operations, onboarding shall be gated by whitelists with zero unauthorized devices and zero address conflicts; therefore success is met when enrollment audits report clean.\n\nSC\u20113 Control sequences, interlocks, and routing\nBecause incorrect actuation is hazardous, one hundred percent of smoke control cause\u2011and\u2011effect sequences shall pass witnessed testing, and all interfaces shall default to safe\u2011state on loss of communication. Therefore success is met when signed Integrated System Test records and replayable logs show correct actuation.\nBecause phased work risks misrouting, evacuation messaging and routing shall be correct by zone with cross\u2011building broadcasts inhibited until the receiving building is accepted. Therefore success is met when dry\u2011run pages and live tests match zone maps.\n\nSC\u20113 Control sequences, routing, safe\u2011state, and failover\nBecause incorrect actuation is hazardous, one hundred percent of smoke control cause\u2011and\u2011effect sequences shall pass witnessed testing, zone\u2011targeted notification shall be correct with cross\u2011building broadcasts inhibited until the receiving building is accepted, and all interfaces shall fail to safe state on loss of communication. Therefore success is met when signed Integrated System Test records and replayable logs show correct actuation and backup communications failover carries alarms without loss while meeting the latency objective.\n\nSC\u20114 Commissioning gates aligned to handovers\nPre\u2011cutover: approved Method of Procedure and Standard Operating Procedure, signed golden configuration, and timed, tested rollback.\nParallel\u2011run: one\u2011way isolation between legacy and new, artificial intelligence in shadow mode with threshold gating, and no duplicate public notifications.\nBuilding cutover: Authority Having Jurisdiction witnessed tests, temporary fire watch if any impairment occurs, and rollback readiness.\nStabilization and campus acceptance: sustained metrics above, as\u2011builts and training delivered, and Authority Having Jurisdiction sign\u2011off.\n\nSC\u20114 Commissioning gates and change control\nBecause parallel operations raise coupling risk, legacy and new shall run in parallel under one\u2011way isolation with artificial intelligence in shadow mode and no duplicate public notifications; all changes shall execute under approved Method of Procedure and Standard Operating Procedure with proven, timed rollback. Therefore success is met when the Authority Having Jurisdiction witnesses building acceptance and temporary fire watch is activated upon any impairment.\n\nSC\u20115 Evidence, compliance, and listings\nBecause code and listings constrain design, all components and analytics shall operate within their listings and certifications; any deviation shall have prior written Authority Having Jurisdiction approval. Therefore success is met when submittals, certificates, signed test artifacts, and immutable telemetry are archived for audit. What gaps do you see?\n\nSC\u20115 Evidence, listing compliance, and auditability\nBecause code and listings constrain design and proof must be durable, all components and analytics shall operate within their listings and certifications or have prior written approval. Therefore success is met when submittals, certificates, signed test artifacts, immutable telemetry, as\u2011builts, training, and enrollment audits are archived and traceable for audit.\n\nThe section establishes clear, safety\u2011first acceptance gates, and this is strong because it links latency, coverage, sequencing, and change control to observable evidence. However, the real\u2011time targets risk being unenforceable without explicit network path budgets and quality of service guarantees, since percentiles alone do not constrain per\u2011segment jitter. Therefore, add per\u2011hop latency and jitter budgets, continuous synthetic probes on each critical path, and automatic impairment escalation to temporary fire watch when tails degrade.\n\nThe backup communications requirement states pass\u2011through under latency objectives, yet it omits explicit failover testing gates and steady\u2011state monitoring for non\u2011primary paths. Because radio, distributed antenna, cellular, and satellite exhibit different loss and delay behaviors, require witnessed switchover drills, steady\u2011state tail tracking on backups, and alarms when backup performance risks breaching decision latency; actual thresholds for each bearer would need to be obtained.\n\nArtificial intelligence is gated to shadow mode, which is prudent, but the criteria do not bound false\u2011positive and false\u2011negative rates by data domain. Because commissioning environments shift rapidly, include dataset version control, drift detection, and acceptance gates that require stable false\u2011positive trends below the nuisance threshold across representative hot work and construction scenarios; the exact acceptable rates require verification.\n\nTime synchronization success is defined as zero ordering inversions, yet the absence of maximum time error budgets and holdover limits weakens assurance. Therefore, specify maximum permissible time error at edge and core, define holdover duration alarms, and require multi\u2011source time with deterministic tie\u2011breaking, then verify with ordered beacons during power and network perturbations.\n\nSecurity and infrastructure hygiene are implied but not formalized into gates. Because life\u2011safety traffic depends on underlying routers and firewalls, add dedicated segment availability targets higher than enterprise baselines, vulnerability scanning coverage and timely remediation ahead of cutover, certificate and key validity checks, and change\u2011freeze windows aligning with commissioning.\n\nWith these augmentations, evidence becomes more auditable, residual risk is reduced, and the criteria align better to end\u2011to\u2011end causality.",

Therefore require physical and logical segregation between safety control and analytics networks, documented unidirectional data flows, listed and isolated gateways, and interlocks that prevent any direct artificial intelligence command path to actuation.\n\nThe one hundred millisecond decision limit is appropriate because life safety sequences are time critical; however there is no defined latency budget, measurement method, or observability. Therefore allocate a segment by segment latency budget, mandate synchronized time across devices, instrument timestamping at each interface, and validate under worst credible load including failover and congestion, with actual test data retained for Authority Having Jurisdiction review.\n\nThe availability target is meaningful because live cutover cannot impair protection; however the measurement scope and common cause controls are undefined. Therefore define the protected function boundary for availability calculation, include brownout ride through and battery autonomy in scope, require independence between redundant power and pathways to avoid common cause failure, and confirm through availability modeling with source data to be obtained.\n\nThe acceptance program is comprehensive because it ties evidence to Authority Having Jurisdiction decisions; however listing integrity across software and firmware updates is not operationalized. Therefore institute an update gate requiring listing impact assessment, vendor attestation, signed packages, secure rollback, and re evaluation when a change could affect a listing, with retention of certificates and change records.\n\nGovernance is emphasized because unmanaged change erodes confidence; however identity and cybersecurity controls are implicit rather than explicit. Therefore require strong initial identity verification, least privilege with role based access control, multi factor authentication for administrators, code signing for all changes, and segmented networks between safety and non safety domains to prevent unauthorized modification.\n\nThese clarifications make compliance and functional safety demonstrable, therefore increasing Authority Having Jurisdiction confidence and preserving listing integrity.",

logging is mandatory yet never blocking of release.\n\nSafety\u2011critical paths that must act within one hundred milliseconds are local and hardwired; software orchestration may supplement but not replace deterministic releases.\n\nIntegration constraints to guide later what\u2011ifs.\n\nDoor position supervision must gate relock to prevent relock while open.\n\nTime source health and priority must prevent priority inversion and desynchronization during alarms.\n\nInterlock bypass must precede any unlock that would otherwise trap occupants in mantraps or turnstiles.\n\nThe created canon closes material gaps in the creative draft by adding network priority inversion, time source loss, split brain controller conditions, and door position supervision semantics, because these are recurrent failure modes that drive relock during alarm and deadline misses in distributed safety paths.\n\nIt organizes guide words across timing, quantity, quality, routing, sequence, location, duration, human factors, environment, power, communications, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, control logic, and maintenance, therefore it enables consistent what\u2011if generation at the exact interfaces where hazards concentrate.\n\nBecause free egress must dominate any competing objective, the authority semantics assert fail unlock by default, door group authority transfer to the fire alarm during alarm, and a deterministic lockdown to evacuation handover; this steers designs toward local hardwired releases within sub one hundred milliseconds and logging that never blocks safety actions.\n\nHowever, the canon alone does not define quantitative verification, therefore actual data would need to be obtained for latency budgets, availability baselines, and door status telemetry accuracy using time synchronized measurement at the controller relay and the supervised door position sensor.\n\nAdditionally, interactions with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning smoke control and elevator dispatch may warrant deeper decomposition and testable preconditions, although the interfaces are already prioritized here to seed the subsequent hazard enumeration.\n\nConsequently, this canon is ready to drive systematic scenario creation for hazard identification and risk evaluation with the stated matrix, starting with critical egress doors that must prove local sub one hundred millisecond release and supervised, safe relock conditions under alarm clear.",
