  "coordinator_instructions": "Produce Step 1: Guide Word Preparation for the SWIFT risk assessment of the Smart Building Integration \u2013 Engineering Department, West Campus Data Centre and Work Centre, with scope focused on AI-Driven Fire Detection with Predictive Analytics. This supports the stated project scope and the SWIFT Step 1 requirement by establishing a common, code-aligned vocabulary of guide words that will structure systematic hazard identification across all subsystems; there is no prior expert content to challenge at this stage.\n\nDeliver a comprehensive, system-tailored list of SWIFT guide words organized into sensible categories that suit this integrated life safety context. At minimum, cover timing and performance, quantity and capacity, quality and integrity, direction and flow, sequence and state, human factors and procedures, cybersecurity and trust, AI/ML model and data, integration and interoperability, commissioning and change, environmental and occupancy, and power and resilience. For each guide word, provide: a succinct definition, and a concise explanation of how it applies to this project, explicitly naming at least two relevant components from the scope (e.g., addressable fire detection with video analytics, HVAC smoke control, IoT sensor mesh with edge processing, automated evacuation routing and mass notification, backup communication channels, real-time networking and compute, and physical security/egress control integration). Keep the prose clear and reproducible, and avoid heavy formatting.\n\nEnsure the guide word set is directly usable for later what-if scenario generation. For example, under timing and performance include items that will probe the <100 ms decision latency requirement and end-to-end determinism; under AI/ML include items that probe false positives, false negatives, model drift, bias, and concept shifts during commissioning; under cybersecurity include items that probe authentication, authorization, availability, integrity, segmentation, and failover of safety-critical paths; under commissioning and change, include items that probe live cutover, parallel run, rollback, and configuration control. Also reflect explicit project challenges: maintaining detection continuity during IT infrastructure migration, managing more than 10,000 IoT endpoints across 15 buildings, meeting sub-100 ms latency for safety-critical decisions, and preventing AI false positives during commissioning.\n\nProvide a simple coding scheme for traceability, such as GW-<CATEGORY>-<NN>, and include a short coverage statement indicating that each major subsystem and subprocess can be explored by at least three distinct guide words. Use consistent terminology and avoid creating hazards, risk ratings, or mitigations at this stage; deliver guide words only so that subsequent steps can reference them verbatim. When referencing standards or codes (e.g., NFPA 72, NFPA 70, NFPA 101, EN 54, IEC 61508, IEC 61511, ISO 31000), use placeholders and mark them as \u201cto be verified\u201d rather than asserting specific clause numbers. Aim for a comprehensive but concise set that is practical for workshop use, roughly thirty to fifty guide words total, expressed in clear argumentative prose with labeled subheadings.",

      "content": "Decision: Life Safety Functional Safety & Code Compliance Expert | Reasoning: We must begin with Step 1 of the SWIFT methodology: Guide Word Preparation. A cross-cutting, code-aligned guide word set should be established first to anchor all subsequent hazard identification and risk assessment across subsystems. The Life Safety Functional Safety & Code Compliance Expert is best positioned to create a comprehensive, system-wide guide word framework that aligns with life safety functions and regulatory expectations, while accommodating AI analytics, HVAC integration, IoT scale, edge performance, and live cutover constraints. This will enable later domain experts to add domain-specific guide words without inconsistency."
