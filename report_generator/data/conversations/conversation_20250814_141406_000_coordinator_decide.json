  "coordinator_instructions": "Produce the SWIFT Step 1 content specifically for the AI fire detection and analytics domain. This supports the start of the assessment by establishing the foundational guide words that will drive systematic hazards brainstorming in later steps. Your task is to deliver a complete, auditable guide-word set tailored to the project context: West Campus Data Centre and Work Centre, fifteen buildings, more than ten thousand IoT endpoints, addressable fire detection integrated with video flame/smoke analytics, IoT sensor mesh with edge processing, intelligent HVAC smoke control, automated evacuation routing fed by real-time fire modeling, and backup communications. Anchor the guide words to the AI detection pipeline and its interfaces without performing hazard identification yet. Provide the section as: Step 1: Guide Word Preparation \u2014 AI Fire Detection & Analytics. In clear prose, define the scope and boundaries you are covering (e.g., camera and sensor inputs, preprocessing, model inference and post-processing, analytics fusion/correlation, alarm decisioning, messaging to fire alarm control and building systems, data transport dependencies, and cloud/edge partitioning), including any assumptions that constrain applicability. Then present a comprehensive guide-word list that at minimum covers timing, quantity, quality, direction, sequence, and human factors, and expand with any additional categories essential for AI-based detection in a mission-critical life-safety context. For each guide word, give a concise definition that is specific to AI fire detection and analytics and explain how it should be interpreted when applied to components such as video analytics, sensor fusion, model management, and alerting. Conclude with a mapping narrative that explains how the guide words will be systematically applied across the AI subsystem components and key interfaces to HVAC smoke control, evacuation modeling, OT/IT networks, and backup communications, explicitly noting performance and scaling constraints such as the less than one hundred millisecond decision latency requirement and live migration during commissioning. Where project-specific data would be required to sharpen guide words, insert a clearly labeled verification required note rather than inventing details. Do not proceed into hazards, risk scoring, or mitigations; deliver only the complete, rationalized guide-word foundation for this domain.",

Given the project\u2019s emphasis on AI-driven detection, false positives during commissioning, and stringent latency, the AI Fire Detection & Analytics Risk Expert is the best first contributor to produce the domain-specific guide words that will anchor subsequent steps. This sets a consistent baseline for all other experts to follow."
