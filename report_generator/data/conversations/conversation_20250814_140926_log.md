**Query**: INTEGRATED LIFE SAFETY SYSTEM DEPLOYMENT RISK ASSESSMENT

Project: Smart Building Integration - Engineering Department, West Campus Data Centre and Work Centre 
Scope: AI-Driven Fire Detection with Predictive Analytics

Deploying next-generation system integrating:
- Addressable fire detection with video flame/smoke analytics
- Integration with HVAC for intelligent smoke control
- IoT sensor mesh (temperature, CO, occupancy) with edge processing
- Automated evacuation routing based on real-time fire modeling
- Backup communication channels

Technical challenges:
- Maintaining detection during IT infrastructure migration
- Managing 10,000+ IoT endpoints across 15 buildings
- Ensuring <100ms response time for all safety-critical decisions
- Preventing AI false positives during commissioning

Assess cybersecurity risks, AI failure modes, and system integration hazards during live cutover.

## Coordinator

Decision: Life Safety Functional Safety & Code Compliance Expert | Reasoning: We must begin with Step 1 of the SWIFT methodology: Guide Word Preparation. A cross-cutting, code-aligned guide word set should be established first to anchor all subsequent hazard identification and risk assessment across subsystems. The Life Safety Functional Safety & Code Compliance Expert is best positioned to create a comprehensive, system-wide guide word framework that aligns with life safety functions and regulatory expectations, while accommodating AI analytics, HVAC integration, IoT scale, edge performance, and live cutover constraints. This will enable later domain experts to add domain-specific guide words without inconsistency.
